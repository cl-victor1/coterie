As soon as I opened them, I instantly felt the difference and couldn’t believe how incredibly soft they were. The real test was of course absorbency, and they absolutely exceeded expectations. I tried them overnight, and they absorbed a full night without any leaks. I previously used Huggies which were great for absorbency, but in the morning I always noticed a very strong urine smell. Coterie absorbs just as well and does not smell! I’ve been on the subscription for the last 5 months and I will never use another diaper.",

I finally sent in an email inquiry to learn what was going on. \n\nJeff replied and Jeff was zero help. It was obvious that he didn&#x27;t take time to look at my account. Jeff gaslit the situation. (The situation: my order was set to go out on Aug 18. I received email communication about, all seemed well. It was now 8 days after my order was supposed to ship, I had not received any shipping info yet and was almost out of diapers. Even though it was 8 days later, my account online still showed that my next ship date of Aug 18. . . I took a screenshot of this on the 26th because it seemed odd) \n\nJeff replied to the email stating that my account says the order is set for Aug 27, which was the very next day. He stated that he saw no issues and asked is there anything else he can help with.\n\nI emailed back, expressed my concerns and sent in screenshots. Then I heard back from Kim. Thank God for Kim. Kim is GREAT!!\n\nKim wrote back and said that she did in fact find a weird glitch with my account. There was something with the payment that wouldn&#x27;t go through. I never received a &quot;card declined&quot; email because it had nothing to do with my card, it was something on the back end with their system. \n\nKim fixed the issue and even provided a discount so that I could buy a few diapers from a local store in the meantime. Kim, you deserve a raise. You made me feel heard and brought clarity to a frustrating situation.\n\nI love these diapers and wipes. Kim, you made me fall in love with the company even more.

These diapers just don’t contain liquid poop well, particularly with an exclusively breastfed baby. We’ve had multiple major blowouts, including one where I ended up throwing away an entire outfit because the mess went all the way down the leg and I didn’t realize it.\n\nThe worst incident happened while we were outside in a rural area on a cold day. My son had on a double-zippered outfit, and I unzipped only from the bottom to change his diaper—not knowing the mess had traveled up. I didn’t have backup wipes or a clean outfit with me. My options were to either force the dirty outfit back over his body, covering him in poop again, or break the zipper to get him out without making things worse. I chose to break the zipper.\n\nI’m giving 3 stars because I do appreciate the comfort and excellent pee protection, and I’ll keep using them for now. But at this price, I expected better blowout protection.

An extra aspect of Coterie thats amazing however is the easiness of ordering on a monthly basis. You get access via txt msg and they have 6 options to choose from. Right now I have two diaper packages left and they notified me 5 days in advance that a shipment will be sent out and I responded with DELAY. They confirm the delayed shipment and specifically stated it will be delayed by one week which is perfect. If i want to change the diaper size, you say SIZE. If you need to be shipped before the 5 days then you say NOW. Now tell me that doesn&#x27;t make the process of buying a diaper so much easier!",

One other thing I noticed is that I can hear him peeing in the diaper and if he’s laying down, the pee drips to the back before it gets absorbed whereas the Huggies ones seems to absorb everything mostly where the pee hits. I’m not sure if his bum is a little too skinny for these diapers or if there’s just a bit too much pee when we’re using these over night but I have had multiple occasions where there were leaks around the bum when he’s getting up in the morning. I’m a little disappointed with the leaking, but despite the occasional complaints about itchiness this is far softer and seemingly more comfortable than our usual options.",

As a parent, knowing that it’s safe and clean for my baby’s delicate skin gives me peace of mind. No harsh chemicals or fragrances, just a natural, gentle material that I trust for my baby. Overall, I’m really happy with this diaper and would definitely recommend it to other parents looking for something reliable and safe!",

I’m giving it another shot and ordering the next size up, because in my opinion they do run a little small. But, I really don’t see myself to continue to purchase these. I really hate they don’t offer samples (like a 2-3pack. ) You HAVE to subscribe and see up reoccurring shipments.

Most diapers I found had a wheat core, for me this was a no as I could react if the gluten became airborne and since we live in a 100% gluten free home.

My one complaint (if I could have one) is that the blow-out barrier in the back and on the legs needs some work as we still have tons of those, but I&#x27;d rather do laundry every day than have him in pain from the rash. The best Diapers on the market for sure!!",

Mille Moon is very soft, but they left my infant’s skin quite damp - even with a small amount of liquid. Not to mention - the recent reviews that mention chemical burns have scared me a bit. \n\nCoterie diapers are incredibly absorbent - my 2. 5 month old can go through 1-3 nursings at night without a diaper change and wake up with her skin mostly dry (no other diaper we have tried does this!)! With my older 3 boys, we had diaper rash from overnight wetness on the regular (do NOT use Target brand overnight - that’s just misery for a sweet kiddo!). My little girl hasn’t had any issues with skin irritation and I don’t anticipate rash from wet diapers if we keep up with Coterie. The only sort of downside I could imagine with this brand is that they are a bit bulkier than any other diaper I’ve used, but not at all like cloth and the pluses give reason to the bulk (softness and absorbency). \n\nThere is one other competitor that is even softer, thinner and apparently even more “natural” that I really like - but her skin is a tiny bit more damp when I change her (but still less so than with many of the other brands). That one can be ordered from Target in smaller amounts, so I’ll probably keep those as a filler or will stock up on when there are sales. \n\nCoterie truly does make an amazing diaper that I believe is better for baby (in terms of ingredients and that they truly keep baby’s skin clean and dry), but of course like any other item - you will pay for it. I’m making it work by choosing not to buy things new with this baby and only use hand me down clothes and what not. If I have to cut costs, then so be it but for now - the bulk of our baby spending money will go towards these awesome diapers!",

As a rule of thumb we change the diaper after 2 night feeds (including one before she goes to sleep as she feeds right before going to bed - not ideal but that’s what she asks for - ). Otherwise it has leaked for us every time, again, I think it is reasonable performance you reasonable expect the diaper to last through 4 feeds \n\nFeels softer although the outer part is softer than the inside part (where it touches baby’s skin). Wish it was the other way around.\n\nWish it was more carbon neutral. We might try Happy Baby to compare a more environmental friendly in the similar price range. \n—-/-/-/-/-/——\n\nOverall satisfied with Coterie, but want to make sure the diaper is as good as their marketing is.

We brought our coterie diapers to NICU and she hasn’t had a diaper rash since! Also with the other brand, she was constantly having blowouts. Since we switched diapers, she hasn’t had any full on blowouts… Only a few poop ‘leaks’ during our 6 weeks of use and I believe it was user error of us not having the ruffles out around the leg or not tight enough at the waist. Our daughter sleeps 10-12 hours over night and the diaper can handle that. She has a full pee diaper every morning with no leaks. If she fusses during the night I will change her, otherwise the diaper keeps her dry enough for her to sleep really well. We love the wipes too. We have tried a few different wipes because of gifts. However, I keep coming back to these. I don’t want to run out! And I don’t even want to finish up using the other gifted wipes! These are thick, wet, and larger. I can use 1-2 wipes per poop. Our daughter is 8 weeks old and in size 1. We did use a full 6 pack of NB when she was born at 6lbs 6oz before switching to size 1. These are premium for a reason. Worth the cost.

After starting using coterie all of our issues went away. I wish I used these diapers with my other kids! Additionally, it is so easy and convenient to have them delivered each month. If you need to update your shipment, order a different size, or delay shipment it is such an easy process.",

For the first year of my daughters life her grandparents wanted to buy her diapers because they knew they wouldn’t see her a lot and wanted to help contribute to the arguably the most trying year of being a parent. After some research on diaper subscriptions and also realizing we had a little one with a sensitive bum… we landed here! While the price is a little higher than the average diapers on shelf, in my opinion it’s completely worth it. It ships right to my door with a months supply that usually always takes me 1 pack or close into the next month always leaving me with some security in case of shipping delays. My daughter is 30inches long now and almost 24lb. We are currently wearing a size 6. After the year was up we countinued our subscription on our own because of the leak protection alone. We had tried other diapers here and there that we were gifted from our shower. Nothing held up like coterie. My boyfriend did a cup test. Haha, men and their experiments. Most all other cups held one-one and a half solo cups while coterie held twice that. They feel so soft and the texture on the outside is gentle and not irritating at all. As a Mama who loves her sleep (who doesn’t!?) I love that my daughter who pees more over night stays dry all night long so she can get her much needed toddler rest too! Excited to see how the pants work for us in the future!",

We eventually tried Coterie, and we have been so impressed. He no longer has any diaper rash, and his skin stays dry. Another pro - I love that there are no designs or prints on the diapers. A few cons - cost being the main one, although I will continue to order Coterie diapers because we have been so happy. Ordering diapers is a breeze, but I wish I could order a smaller or larger amount of diapers rather than a one months supply.

Their wipes are larger than competitors, they’re thicker, and they stay damp longer (it could be a better locking mechanism on their wipe pack or maybe just more liquid added I’m not sure). Also the coterie wipes come out easier, like one wipe at a time vs other wipes that come out in multiples - causing you to usually use more wipes.

He still fusses the moment he pees and I still change diapers at the same frequency as other brands. This means I run out of diapers after 2-3 weeks instead of 4 weeks. The sizing is also on the smaller end that my son grows out of the diaper at the third week. This happened with both the size 1 and 2 whereas his pampers last 4-5 weeks in those sizes. So he tends to blow out of them more out the back and legs. I may likely discontinue since the negatives are starting to outweigh the positives.",

You can text to skip a month or to size up and get notifications when it’s coming up, so it’s honestly one less thing I have to remember to do and I know now that I’ll never have to run to the store or remind myself to buy on Amazon anymore. They also give you a trial pack of 5 diapers in the next size up so you know when your baby is ready for the next size.

No weird smells, no plastics feeling, just something that would feel nice to wear.\n\nAbsorption is great, for most messes the diaper is quick to wick up and tends to leave your little one dry. We’ve had some moments where it can struggle a little bit as we’ve had quite a few blow outs or leaks. Probably due to our babies size being right at the limit of weight for the respective size. Do yourself a favor and size up if you think it’s a little too snug or small.\n\nDo I think these are the game changing diapers that will lead to more sleep? Not exactly but maybe for some babies.

It absorbs so well that even once used it is hard to tell because it keeps the urine off babies skin. Unexplainable. It will still feel dry inside the diaper. We are so impressed with the diaper and the thickness and softness of the wipes that I had to make a FB post to credit the brand and let my friends know about the products. We will NEVER use another brand. Expecting a Granddaughter in June and we will be adding to our subscription. Thank you so much for making a product like this.

Now we are on size 1 and the same thing happened when he was 10,5-11 we started to have consistent blowouts. I would recommend updating the sizing chart.

At that point we had already decided Coterie felt the nicest to the touch.\nThen baby girl was born long and skinny (has plumped up nicely now) but had to wear Pampers preemie diapers in the hospital.\nHere’s what we found:\nThe EcoPea are terrible- so cardboard and stiff that it was hard to get them on her. The newborn size didn’t want to bend around her body. We had been using the coterie diapers but I pulled these out as not to waste them and after his first time changing her my husband asked my what happened to the good diapers. Plus we had a urine leak. \nThe Pampers were seriously better than the EcoPea. \nThe Dyper diapers are OK. There’s no print at all so you will put one on backwards in the middle of the night. They are crinkly compared to Coterie too, not near as soft but probably second best. \nHello Bello are also OK and less bulky than EcoPea and Dyper but still have a plastic film, more like pampers. Plus the garish design is not my favorite. If I have her dressed in a white or earth toned onesie or dress I don’t want a bright purple and green diaper peeking out. \nI was happy with the Coterie before we decided to try the other brands. Now I realize the leaps and bounds better Coterie is when truly compared. \nPrice wise Dyper and EcoPea run similar to Coterie and I would certainly not buy either again. I know there are cheaper diapers out there but this is the single baby item with the most contact with my precious little one. I think it’s entirely reasonable to be very selective about diapers. Yes they are disposable but they are also the one thing your baby will wear every single day. \nCoterie FTW for sure.",

She had stated at one of her past appointments that diapers wouldn’t make a difference in preventing her diaper rash, but at her recent appointment she said that we made a good choice in diapers, because I mentioned to her that I did a little research on diapers. I informed her once we switched to Coterie we only use ointment if she has consecutive bowel movements. I informed her that we are also environmentally conscious so using Coterie is a double win for us! Her pediatrician said she would share this info with other parents.

Diaper rash? Never! He used to get such horrid diaper rash in the honest diapers. We used Cod Liver oil and switched to Coterie and it was the best diapering decision I’ve ever made and I stand proudly by it! \nWhat about fit?\nThese diapers grow with my peanut. We are currently 16 lbs and in size 2. I presume he will be in this size for a month or a little more. It’s super easy to know when you need to size-up and the sizes are standard and true to the weight limit they claim.\nSwitch to Coterie.

She eventually grew into them, but it was annoying (per my prior point) to have to store a huge box of diapers because we couldn&#x27;t order two sizes or just one pack to assess the proper size.

Last week I had ran out of boosters and was worried but for the first time in months she woke up dry without adding the booster. These diapers are amazing. I 100% recommend!",
