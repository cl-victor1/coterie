However right now I'm past 32 weeks and wondering if my bump is big enough for 32 weeks. I saw many women whose bump at 32nd mark bigger. Does my bump look smaller for 32 weeks? I understand that every body is different so I could be having a slightly smaller bump at this gestation, but I'm also wondering if the size of bump has anything to do with the growth of the baby.\n\nMy recent scan did mention that the baby weights less by about 50-100 h than it should be. So I'm relating this reading with my bump.\n\nWould appreciate your thoughts and inputs.

      "content": "I just found out I was pregnant a few days ago because my period didn’t start at the precise time it always has. I’m still in shock and feel really conflicted. My situation is a little unusual and maybe sounds like a non-issue to some but I’m feeling kind of scared and I don’t know if this is something anyone else has gone through? Or, does everyone? \n\nI’m 36 years old and my husband and I have been married for 11 years. Our first few years of marriage were really rough for financial and family reasons and we kind of worked our way out of the gutter together. I was an RN during the pandemic, then went back to school and got my doctorate, and now have a very cushy, good paying job. My husband has moved up the ladder at his company and actually just accepted a very good director type position with a new company and is starting that Dec 1st. We’ve just always been on the go and having kids was not a priority.\n\nI guess the issue of that we’ve been so focused of surviving, then our careers, that we never allowed ourself room for kids. I know my husband is incredibly in love with me, he’s always been so supportive and encouraging of my career and school but I’ve heard him loudly profess to others how great it is to be child free and things like that. To be fair I did it too, but maybe not as often. Being a mom was just never something I wanted. We have plans to travel to Europe every year and do all kinds of things that childless people in our late thirties entering forties do.\n\nFast forward to now, I fumbled with the timing of my nuvaring placement because of our crazy schedule and didn’t think much of it, I’ve gone this long in life without getting pregnant and now I’m “Advanced maternal age” or whatever. Well, I had a positive pregnancy test and took several more over the last few days and the positive lines seem to come faster and faster. \n\nAnd weirdly… I’m not mad about it. 10 years ago? I would absolutely want an abortion no question but right now I don’t. And I’m scared to tell my husband only because I know his reaction is going to be very emotional— either in the direction of joy or most likely the opposite, like freaking out like “How are we going to do this”. At least initially, as we have no reliable family around us so it’d just be us. And it’s going to be extra stress and pressure on him starting this new position that involves a lot of travel. We have great new financial stability but I know having a kid is going to be a lot regardless lol. I have my first ultrasound booked for Dec 12th and plan on telling him later this next week, I’m just really freaked out about it.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long winded back story, just looking for some insight if anyone maybe went through something similar because right now I feel like I can’t confide in any of my friends because the father of my baby still doesn’t know about it. Anyone have to tell a long established “child free” enthusiast that they’re pregnant but want to keep it and cancel all their life plans lol?",

          "body": "It’s not the same thing because we already had a toddler, but my husband was becoming pretty certain he was one and done when whoops, pregnant. It was very unexpected because it took over a year of trying to get #1, and we weren’t being as careful as we might have been just because it seemed so unlikely after having to work so hard on it. But here we are. The first words out of his mouth when I told him were “what the fuck” so, uh, not exactly positive, but he (barely) stopped short of asking me to get an abortion. Meanwhile I had been really grieving my hopes of a second kid and couldn’t imagine not keeping this baby. I’d also always told him that while I’m very pro-choice I couldn’t imagine getting an abortion myself—even back when we met in college I very much wanted to have kids, and it was tough to have to wait until we were ready emotionally, financially, professionally, etc. \n\nIt’s honestly been very hard, he’s accepting the reality that there will be a baby and I expect he’ll help contribute to baby care and all that, but it’s not the life he had in mind. If you haven’t expressed this openness to your husband before (maybe you didn’t know about it!) he might feel a bit blindsided by you not wanting to abort. It’s hard because what my husband is grieving is a really valid thing—we were just getting to the point of being able to see a light at the end of a tunnel of sleep deprivation, diapers, throwing food, etc. and going back to it when he thought relief was on the horizon isn’t easy. And for your husband giving up the plans of travel and freedom and accepting the pressures that come with being a parent—it’s all a lot and even if he loves you very much and is committed to seeing it through together, it can be hard. I’ve also struggled to find IRL support because I don’t really want to broadcast my husband’s ambivalence to our friends and family, it’s not just about him but this future child who I imagine he’ll one day have a very loving relationship with. But that’s left me feeling pretty isolated and mostly turning to online channels and my therapist for support. \n\nAnyway, it sounds like you have the resources to make this work, and I do hope for you this is a more joyful surprise for your husband than it was for mine. But I also found that anticipating telling him was the worst part, even being present through some of his grief, frustration, and fear has been easier than wondering how he was gonna take it. I hope you have a good conversation this week, and one way or another it sounds like you’re pregnant with a wanted baby and the resources to raise them, which is a huge blessing regardless of everything else.",

We’d talked about it before and decided we were maybe open to it in the future but SURPRISE, it happened now! I took the test when he was working and told him as soon as he got home. I was so scared that my husband was going to freak out and immediately stress, but you know what? This amazing man immediately accepted it and said that he’s ready and it will be our next adventure. I immediately broke down crying with relief and now a week later we’re getting more excited and make silly jokes about our kid ordering caviar and being bougie on all our future travels as a family.

We are expecting another in a few months, and are planning a solo kid-free weekend babymoon in a month. I do have parents that live nearby (and will watch her for 3 nights when we're out of town) but they aren't super involved, so that's no guarantee even if you did have a close support network. \n\nIf your husband is willing to be a true partner in raising the kiddo, it can be awesome.

If it was going to make a big financial difference, and there wasn’t a medical reason that was going to impact the safety of me and my baby, I would probably induce. Early parenthood has so many ups and downs and challenges - if I could mitigate financial stress, I personally would! \n\nYou are going to get so many different takes as responses, I’m sure!

      "content": "I live in a rural area and I started going to my local hospital for care when I found out I was pregnant. I was told that due to my BMI, the local hospital would not be able to administer anesthesia for delivery and I’d need to deliver at a larger hospital 1.5 hours away. The larger hospital is within the same hospital group and they have better equipment and a much better women’s care team. I was fine with transferring care but they told me I’d need to do NSTs twice a week starting at 32-33 weeks. They told me I could do one of the tests at my local hospital and the other at the larger hospital, that way I wouldn’t have to make the drive twice a week for a 20 minute test.\n\nLast week I had an ultrasound at my local hospital to check my baby’s growth and because of her positioning, they weren’t able to get an accurate measurement of the amniotic fluid. It looked to be low but the tech said there was another pocket of fluid that couldn’t be counted because the baby was in the way. They ended up ordering a BPP and  by the time it was performed, my baby had moved and the level went from 5 to 8. Which was great!\n\nI went to my local hospital for my first NST this week at 33 weeks and the doctor on call was one I’d never met before. He said he was concerned about the results of the NST but never explained why. He ordered another BPP. When they measured the fluid, it was again measuring around 5. I explained that we had the same thing happen 4 days ago and it looked lower than it was because my baby is in a weird position (she’s breech and nearly transverse). He didn’t listen to that.\n\nThe doctor told me “if one more thing goes wrong, we will be preparing to deliver this baby today.” He also told me my placenta was “beat up.” I’ve had several ultrasounds including 2 with MFM and none of them have said anything about an issue with the placenta. He told me he wanted me to stay another 6-8 hours for monitoring and recommended steroid injections to prepare the baby for preterm delivery and said “if you were my patient, you’d be getting a shot in your butt today.” He also explained that steroid injections are not common practice in my state and other doctors would disagree with him.\n\nHe never consulted with my primary care team or MFM about any of this. He repeatedly told me to prepare for a preterm baby. He told me that if we delivered that day, I’d have to stay at the local hospital and my baby would be transported to the larger hospital where they have a NICU. I refused to stay and told him I’d call my primary care team.\n\nMy team asked me to come in to their hospital for monitoring so I did. I was on the monitor for nearly 3 hours. My baby was totally fine. They reviewed the results of the BPP from that day and while the fluid was on the low end, it was still within normal range so there was no need for concern. They contacted MFM just to double check and ask for their recommendation. MFM said everything was totally normal and there was absolutely no reason to consider preterm delivery at this point. They suggested I see them again for an ultrasound to get an accurate measurement of the fluid.\n\nI checked my chart notes from the local hospital and none of the doctor’s recommendations or concerns were noted. Nothing about steroids. Nothing about potential preterm delivery. But he did schedule me for 2 appointments with Anesthesia for that day! Which confirms to me that he was preparing for delivery. I believe 100% that if I’d stayed at my local hospital, that doctor would have pushed me into an “emergency” c-section for absolutely no reason.\n\nI’m still in shock over all of this. I’m wondering how many vulnerable mothers have been put in unnecessary danger by this man. I filed a complaint with the hospital and I will most likely file one with the state medical board as well.",

My MIL is obsessed with how “big“ I am and is convinced the baby is ready. First of all, please stop talking about how HUGE I am. Second, no she ain’t.  \n\n  \nMy coworkers are all convinced that once I’m past a big work event this week, I’ll deliver.  \n\n  \nY’all I’m 34 weeks pregnant. Baby would be 34-35 weeks and a PREMIE. Not a significant premie, but still early enough to have potential complications and need time in the NICU. This baby is a double rainbow and my family and I have been through enough. I know I’m being sensitive, but I’m just so over the comments.  \n\n  \nAnyone else experience people around you basically hoping you have a premature baby??? This is so bizarre to me and has never happened with my previous babies.",

I get people are excited for me but they don't seem to consider the anxiety you have, especially as a ftm that everything will be well and the baby will stay in and get everything she needs, which was my worry for my whole pregnancy so it rattled me to feel like people were willing her to come prematurely",

They also have no nurse line to call and it's only an online portal they take weeks to respond to messages.\n\nWell yesterday I got a call that the next OB I was scheduled with is suddenly out of office so they cancelled my 34 week and 36 week appointments and said they can't see me with any provider until December 18th.\n\nI told them this was unacceptable because I have pressing concerns for a pre-existing heart condition, rising BP (nearing 140...), and haven't had any discussion on what to look for in terms of signs of labor, baby position, etc... and they told me there was nothing they could do, I'd be fine, and that a lot of first time mom's have \"unnecessary anxiety\" and to just call 911 if I have any concerns.\n\nI am just was floored by this. With the way they've been treating me at my last 2 appointments I guess I'm not surprised but I am so stressed!\n\nWe called around all day yesterday and found one place that would take me this late but they can't see me until December 1st and there is no guarantee I will be able to get scheduled for another appointment before the due date as they are already scheduling out into January. \n\nI'm really scared at this point. I'm not having issues that require a hospital right now thankfully but things have been going downhill so I'm just really concerned it could go there. I REALLY need an OB! My specialists tell me to defer to an OB for the pregnancy. \n\nAlso being a FTM with no friends or family nearby I don't really know specifics in what to look for in terms of labor. I'm only 33 weeks so it's not the most pressing concern but I've had zero talks with the OB office on this yet. Last two appointments were useless and I was just told \"you can discuss that at your next appointment\" because it was different OBs, one who flat out said she didn't have time to read my chart.\n\nI don't know, I'm just scared and could use some advice.",

My baby is in the NICU due to critical bilirubin levels and to say I’m stressed is an understatement and honestly my mom is not helping. \n\nWe have a password on our tv bc my oldest has adhd and we have to severely limit the electronics for him. He gets a serious attitude and gets difficult to deal with if he has much access so we limit things. I gave my mom the password to the tv and told her explicitly not to give it to my son. We did lax on the tv rules while we were out having the baby and while we’re gone to visit her in the hospital so he could have some entertainment while we’re away and busy. Anyway she turned around yesterday and gave it to him and said it was out of “convenience” because she was upstairs and didn’t wanna come downstairs to enter it for him. \n\nAnd today, we ordered a small Instacart order bc we just don’t have time to go to the store and it delivered while we weren’t home. She brought it in an hour after the fact, and fortunately the milk was still cold so we were able to salvage that, but she didn’t bother to go through any other bag to see if we had cold stuff. So we lost all that. \n\nLike, come on. Is it really that hard to just double check to see if there’s anything that needs to be refrigerated? Or respect the boundaries we have in place for the bigger kids? My son could’ve waited on the tv for a few mins, long enough for her two wrap up whatever the fuck she was doing and come down. So now here I am crying over groceries bc my life feels like it’s falling the fuck apart right now and I have no control. I ended up snapping at her over the groceries.

But he got every key person except his mom (who is recovering from various surgeries) to come!!! \n\nOur beloved best friend in the area paid for catering which was INCREDIBLE. So many people were so generous with their time and money. I'm just beside myself.\n\nLike seriously, we were walking through the building we both work in to get lunch as usual, and he went, oh yeah, and I have this thing to show you and not 5 seconds later I was standing in a room with my loved ones!!! It was so surreal to see my brother standing there. And my sister came a bit later and she brought her 6 month old whom I haven't seen since she was a tiny little newborn!!! \n\nI've felt so brave knowing that I don't have my own parents or anything. I adore and look up to my boss, but I wouldn't have had the courage to ask her and her husband to come to a baby shower. I thought it would be more than I could ask to get my siblings to my dissertation, let alone a party to celebrate my precious little one. But my husband did it. He really did. \n\nThe fact that it was all a surprise is INSANE because I'm pretty good at telling when things are off with him 😅 I noticed last night that he was clinging to his phone but I thought nothing of it other than \"how will he know his phone is charging if it's upside down?\" since his charging port is broken 😂\n\nThe decorations were beautiful. The food was awesome. My loved ones were perfect. I couldn't have asked for anything better. It was truly magical.\n\nOh yeah, he's gonna be a good daddy. I'm so excited!",

She was expected to help raise us, manage household responsibilities, be the “mature one,” and never really had space to express her emotions. Now as an adult, she carries a lot of the classic eldest-daughter traits: emotional suppression, hyper-independence, people-pleasing, and always feeling responsible for everyone.\n\nSeeing that has made me determined not to repeat the same pattern with my own daughter, especially if I have more kids in the future.\n\nMy questions are:\n\t•\tWhat can parents do practically to make sure the eldest daughter doesn’t end up parentified or emotionally overburdened?\n\t•\tWhat things should I avoid saying/doing?\n\t•\tHow do you balance responsibility fairly when future siblings arrive?\n\t•\tAre there signs I should watch for in childhood that indicate emotional suppression or parentification?\n\nI want her to grow up feeling secure , expressive and not pressured to be “the strong one” from a young age.\n\nIf you grew up as an eldest daughter, or if you’re a parent who has successfully avoided this dynamic, I’d really love your advice or perspective.\n\nThank you in advance ❤️",

I’d obviously have to check with my wife’s insurance, but i assume they’d cover most emergency healthcare costs since Puerto Rico is a US territory. \n\nI’d also like to hear your thoughts on safety and sense of relaxation in terms of the east side of the island. \n\nOther places we are looking at are the Cancun area and maybe Bermuda, but I don’t want to risk healthcare and be in an isolated place that is not a US territory. \n\nThanks!",

Or should we just postpone trying to next month? We don’t have any kids, we are in our early 30’s and we want to be mom and dad to multiple littles... So, we know we need to start trying soon! We tried last month with no pregnancy, so we aren’t under the impression that it’ll happen quickly or in the next try even…I just don’t know how I would feel at 4 or 5 weeks pregnant…is that even noticeable?

My grandma recently reached out to my mom to ask if there was anything we still wanted for the baby. My mom checked with me that our registry was up-to-date (it was) and then sent her our registry. There were still quite a few things on there we needed/wanted (the Hatch, some cute toddler dishes, some washcloths, etc). \n\nGrandma reportedly comes back saying there's nothing left on the registry. There was - I'm guessing what she meant is that there's nothing \"fun\" on the registry. She asks my mom if I'd instead be interested in a specific personalized art print that she also got for my cousin's baby. Truthfully, that sort of thing just isn't my taste. But I understood she wanted to buy us something more exciting than reusable wipes, so my mom let her know we'd really appreciate some classic kids books, as we didn't have any yet for bedtime. Even gave examples like The Hungry Caterpillar. \n\nWell, we got the books in, but instead of classic children's literature, she sent us religious kid books (like a baby bible, my first Mass, etc). \n\nWe are religious, so I don't mind that part. But like, why even ask us twice what we want if you're just gonna ignore us both time? It wouldn't annoy me if she hadn't asked and just sent us the books out of the blue. But this way just gives the impression that you're primarily buying a gift to feel validated as the giver rather than to be generous. I'm sure the motivation is more complex than that, but dang, it feels really misguided to me. Weirdly devaluing.",

So, yeah. I want something hands-free, something I can wear while doing, you know… life. Moving around the house, cleaning whatever disaster I walk into, heating leftovers, maybe even just sitting without being tied to a wall like a phone on 1% battery.\n\nThere are too many pumps out there. Too. Many. They all claim to be silent, magical, life-changing. Some look like tiny UFOs. Some cost as much as a weekend trip. And I can’t tell which ones actually get milk out without making me feel like a dairy robot.\n\nRight now I’m eyeing a few:\n\n* Elvie Pump (it looks sleek but maybe too sleek?)\n* Willow Gen 3\n* Spectra Freestyle Hands-Free — this one confuses me, not gonna lie, but people swear by Spectra in general\n\nIf you’ve tried any of these, or if there’s one you love that I haven’t even heard of yet, please tell me everything. Did it actually let you move? Was the output decent or did it feel like a polite suggestion? How annoying was the cleaning… I swear half of these have more parts than a LEGO set. And comfort - did it pinch? Leak? Do that weird shifting thing?\n\nAnyway. I’d really, really appreciate real experiences because I’m trying not to blow money on something that ends up living in a drawer forever.",

I find myself having regrets over the baby’s surname which we decided somewhat on a spur of the moment at the hospital when filling out the birth certificate form. In the midst of fresh postpartum and newborn trenches I am getting quite emotional and stressed over the baby being “stuck” with this last name that no one likes and I start to feel is wrong for our family. \n\nWe haven’t picked up the birth certificate yet as it’s not yet the two week mark but I wanted to ask if anyone’s had a similar experience and were able to change the baby’s name relatively easily? I know the laws vary by state but I understood that once the birth certificate is set, the process is tedious and includes filing a court order and attending a hearing, all of which may take weeks, and we’re hoping to travel soon so baby needs a passport asap. However I just read a comment by someone from my state that said, if you haven’t picked up the birth certificate yet, just go in person and they’ll update it and issue a new one on the spot. It wasn’t a very detailed post but I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience??\n\nThanks in advance, these postpartum hormones are no joke!!!",

      "content": "Hello, I was in this situation and am making this post to share my experience. If this helps even one person, it will be worth it. This is a long post, but I want to walk you through all the things that I think are very important for anyone who is pregnant to consider. First, this is your choice and only your choice. You are the only person that you can reliably count on and this decision should be swayed by no one else or regret is more likely to happen. Anybody pressuring you is dead wrong. I found out I was pregnant when I was four weeks, my birth control failed, and it was very unexpected. The hormonal changes I experienced began right away. I’m talking within a couple of days of implantation (track my cycle closely). It was shocking to me the natural instinct to protect the pregnancy and while I had conflicted feelings, it was clear that my physiology was naturally prompting me to continue. Please know when you’re considering what to do that you brain is literally being hijacked by very powerful hormones which is normal, it’s evolutionary. AND thinking through the following things is imperative for you to feel confident about your choice and go into it with eyes wide open. This post is USA focused.\n\n-the cost of childcare: research and think through what kind of education you want for your children. Do you want in-home or Montessori or play-based ect, do you have a neurodivergence that you think your child will also likely inherit? Then, do some research and find out what parents in your area are generally paying. In many places you have to get on a waitlist when you are pregnant or your child will not have a spot. Daycare is running people 2K 3K a month in major cities. If schools are bad in your area, how much would it cost to move, what does rent cost in that area? Even if your mom says she’s gonna take of baby during the day PLAN AHEAD! That may not happen, people drop out of being childcare for parents even though they promised all the time just check out the parenting subs.\n\n-the cost of medical care: a normal vaginal delivery can run you $6000 after insurance. Get in touch with your insurance provider and ask how much people generally pay for uncomplicated delivery or C-sections. This will not give you an idea of how much it’ll cost if things go wrong, but you’ll at least have a ballpark estimate on the minimum that you’ll be expected to pay for having your baby. If you want a Doula for labor support, birthing class (which everyone should try to take to reduce trauma through preparation) you need to factor that in as well. It’s also important to think about the fact that children under five have weak immune systems and tend to get sick frequently. If you live in the US, you will be paying many many co-pays for the first five years of life not including any medications or ER visits, etc. can you add a third person’s routine and expensive medical care to your budget?\n\nYour career: after factoring in these costs, consider also your relationship with your partner, and whether or not these childcare costs could eat up your salary. There are many women that are forced to stay home for the first five years of life because they cannot afford childcare. This means that you will have no one funding your retirement for that period of time and no income. Just get on SAHM sub and you will find many stories of women with abusive or shitty or useless partners who they want to leave, but they can’t because they have no income and it takes them much longer to be able to get out of that situation. Additionally, while this is wrong and fucked up, the fact is being out of the workforce even for a few years will have permanent effects on your career trajectory. This is not me pulling this out of my ass. There is research behind the fact that your earning potential never fully recovers if you stay home. There’s already stigma on motherhood in the workplace that’s not on fathers, and that is compounded by leaving the workforce temporarily. You can be passed up for promotions and it will be harder to get to where you want to be which doesn’t mean you won’t eventually get there, but statistically it will be harder. That is wrong and we should elect people that will pass legislation to tax billionaires and fund common sense support for hard-working, middle class families, but given that we don’t have systemic change right now, you need to think about what’s true for you in this moment.\n\nThere are many other factors to consider such as your lifestyle and your experience with children. If you were someone that does not have a frame of reference for the day to day reality of parenting can you babysit? Can you find a way to figure out if this is really for you by having even a few hours of firsthand experience on what parenting is like? While it is absolutely true that it is different when they are your own, you will at least have a reasonable understanding of what parenthood is like outside of the beautiful moments that occur with your child, because that is not how you’ll be spending most of your time with them, it’s a lot of repetitive caretaking, which is beautiful in its own way, but not for some people and they resent it so having an idea about what that will be like is really important to your happiness.\n\nLastly, I just want  say that you matter, your hopes and dreams and desires absolutely matter and if no one says that to you, I will. you are the person that has to live with the consequences of this decision and you are the only person that should be making it based on what you want AND what is realistic for your life. If you are a person that is low income or you feel really overwhelmed when you sit down to do the math (which is not all encompassing by the way, I’m not even including baby items formula the additional cost of groceries, etc) look up how much it takes to qualify for Medicaid snap EBT WIC, etc. in your state and what the requirements are for renewing applications. Many people find that they are really struggling, but they are still above the threshold to get any kind of help. And again that is wrong and the only way to fix that is by getting people in office that will pass laws that are gonna deliver help for hard-working parents, but you need to deal in what’s real for you and having a realistic understanding of how much help you can expect to get and how much you’re going to spend is really important. I want to be clear that I am not saying that only rich people should have children. I am not a rich person, I’m a middle class American that has always wanted a family. But the consequences for women and the statistics about how unplanned pregnancy can plunge you into poverty are just to grave for me to not give you this message and I feel that many people when they are in this situation don’t have anyone that talks them through these points. Sending anyone reading this so much love and support. No matter what you decide to do you got this and I’m proud of you. ❤️",

Did this get better or go away for you?\n\nWhen my baby (~8 weeks) is nursing, my upper body on that whole side gets incredibly itchy, as if all the hairs have stood up and are super sensitive. Sometimes it's so intense I have to take my shirt off and even let my bra strap fall down to make sure no fabric is touching me. Such an odd feeling!",

      "content": "FTM here! \nI just need to vent after today’s OB appointment…\n\nA little backstory is that I’m an American currently in Belgium to give birth since that’s where my fiancé lives. My first due date at around 7 weeks was December 16th but was thought to be the 23rd based off my cycle history over the last few years. However, my cycle during the last year before getting pregnant was very regular and not long but we stuck with the 23rd anyways. Now during every scan, baby girl always was measuring a week or bit further ahead, which made us think she’s just a big baby haha. Anyways, I went back to America for three months and during that time I saw my OB in America. I had a full scan done in October and my doctor wanted to keep the due date as the 16th based off my scans and the fact that baby is always measuring ahead the entire pregnancy. She measured on track at every appointment, so did my weight gain. Fast forward to today, my first appointment back in Belgium and the OB does not want to touch my due date and says she’s right and my other doctor isn’t. I did mention I had a scan before seeing her back in May in the U.S but she didn’t care. She did a quick scan today to check if she’s head down and what do you know…gestational age estimated at 35w, 2d! I know the measurements don’t necessarily match but I can’t help but shake the feeling I’m NOT 34w, I’m actually 35 this week. \nAnyways, to the point of this whole vent; the doctor kept telling me I’m having a big baby and would not stop repeating it. Baby girl is estimated 5.7lbs currently. She told me repeatedly to stop eating so much sugar, to eat healthy, that I need to watch my weight. My previous doctor said I was on track and I don’t have gestational diabetes either. My poor fiancé tried to tell her I eat vegetables and walk and all of that, but she once again said about how baby was big and it’s essentially my fault. I honestly just felt defeated, and now confused on what my due date is; but baby will come when she wants to! \nAnyone else have interesting experiences with their doctor though?? 😅",

I found out I’m having a girl today, my husband is the last one to carry the name on and honestly has been “one of the girls” in every masculine and caring way you can imagine. He has done everything for me. I really wanted to give him a little work buddy to cowboy with and teach how to play golf. We have 2 girl cats and now he will live in a house with nothing but feminine energy🤣🩷 I thought he would be disappointed but he was shaking with excitement. He said he can still teach her all the things he loves and has a “buddy” in her still. And I know he does. We both do. She will be adored. I love the thought of having a girl. I wonder who she’ll be, what she’ll look like, and what she will accomplish. But immediately after I found out, fear set in. I was SA as a child my whole life (by a family member) as well as in college and even at my first cooperate job at 18 when my superior was 50 something. A sex offender lives 600 feet away from us (news I found out 2 weeks ago being up late at night and googling). People scare me. I didn’t know I hadn’t worked this shit through. I’ve been to therapy, I’m diagnosed with PTSD as well as other things due to my trauma, and now all I can do is cry thinking someone may hurt my baby girl the way I was hurt. I know first hand you can’t prevent everything. My mom and dad tried and they were amazing parents, but even they couldn’t predict what God awful things were done to me out of their sight by people they trusted. I don’t know how to feel. I’m obsessed with the thought of her. Girl power, her being strong willed, kind, smart, and so many other things I know she will be. I’m just so scared. I already want to shield her from everything. I will continue therapy to see how I can combat the fear and be the best mom I can be. This post may seem scatter brained but that’s how I feel. Any words of encouragement would be appreciated, please don’t condemn me. I’m not disappointment per se, I’m scared to death really. \n\nGood news is my baby girl is healthy and low risk for everything. I’m so thankful. 💝",

      "content": "I wanted to share my birth experience and get opinions from others because something about it still doesn’t feel right.\n\nI was induced at 39 weeks. At 3:45 pm, the doctor checked me and said I was only 1 cm dilated. She inserted Cervidil and told me to relax as “nothing would happen until the next morning.” She left and said she would see me in the morning.\n\nAround 6 pm, I suddenly started having very intense abdominal pressure and cramps with almost no break between them. I thought it might just be gas because I had eaten a chickpea sandwich earlier. I went to the washroom twice, pooped, passed gas, and felt slightly better, so I assumed it wasn’t labour.\n\nBut the pain kept getting worse, so I asked the nurse to check if these were contractions. She put me on the monitor and confirmed that I was actually in labour. I asked what happens next, and she said they would wait for the doctor to come remove the Cervidil.\n\nMy contractions became extremely strong with almost no gap. A nurse checked around 8–9 pm and said the Cervidil was no longer inside. I told her maybe it fell out when I was in the washroom, because I was in so much pain I didn’t notice. She called the OB, and when the doctor checked, she said the Cervidil had gone too high up and she removed it then. This felt strange to me, but I was in too much pain to understand what was going on.\n\nMy pain kept escalating. At midnight, my water broke. The nurse checked me and said I was already 4 cm dilated. I asked for an epidural, got it around 2 am, and by 4 am I was 6 cm, but feeling no pain anymore.\n\nHowever, the nurses and doctors looked stressed. My baby’s heart rate was staying high (170–175) and sometimes dropping to 160. Around 5 am, they said the baby seemed distressed and wanted to do a scalp lactate test (the one where they poke the baby’s head to check oxygen levels). The baby passed the test, but the heart rate stayed too high.\n\nThey couldn’t find any reason for why the heartbeat was high. Around 5:45 am, they told me that either I could continue trying for a vaginal birth, but they would need to keep doing that test every hour, and things could go wrong during pushing — or I could choose a C-section. They made it sound risky to continue, so I chose a C-section. I was already 8 cm at that time, very close to delivering vaginally.\n\nAfter all this, I overheard a nurse saying that they had given me two Cervidils. I’m confused and concerned.\nWhy would they give me two?\nIs that normal?\nIs that why my labour progressed so aggressively in two hours?\nSomething about how the nurses and doctor were talking made me feel like something wasn’t right, but I couldn’t understand it in the moment because of the pain.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? I’m trying to understand if this was a normal situation or a mistake in the induction process.",

Sometimes we joke amongst each other that you ‘got the good dose’ of cervidil or something along those lines when it seems to work very well. \n\nCervidils come individually wrapped and boxed. It’s highly unlikely you had two placed at the same time, without the provider intentionally opening two boxes and two separate metal foil packages. This would have been intentional and obvious. \n\nI clearly don’t know what happened or why your baby was tachycardic. I would assume that your healthcare team were trying various things to bring baby’s heart rate down and they weren’t working (giving you fluids, changing positions, reducing pitocin if it was on, etc). Sometimes high FHR can indicate an infection is starting. Honestly, most centres where I work don’t even do scalp lactate, so it’s nice that was even an option. \n\nYouve had some sound advice on here already to ask for a review of your records and a debrief. Hopefully this can provide you with some clarity over what truly happened that day!",

      "content": "I, 27f, am currently almost 12 weeks pregnant with my first and feeling very conflicted over when (and quite frankly, *if*) to share this news with my bio family. Warning for child abuse/neglect and addiction in post.\n\nSome relevant info (sorry for the long post): my fiancé 28m(baby's dad) and I have been together for eight months and due to life circumstances (working together on the same fishing boat), we've been living together since day one. We both come from pretty messed-up backgrounds: lots of trauma, homelessness, addiction, etc.. We are both sober from 'hard' substances, (well, I don't use anything anymore, obviously, aside from a daily coffee), have a strong and healthy relationship, have good jobs, and are working our asses off to ensure that our little one will have a safe and stable home to grow up in. I know I'm inviting judgment here because of how briefly we've been together and because we are both in recovery and have dark pasts. \n\nI left home at 16 after a very painful childhood that included prenatal drug exposure, physical/emotional/sexual abuse by my mother/her boyfriends and her adult male family members (which she knew about but did nothing to prevent or address; I know it's not entirely her fault as she is also a victim of incest abuse), and neglect. It was made clear that my siblings and I were unwanted and she was always very vocal about wishing she'd aborted us. I then spent several years involved in homelessness, DV, sex/drug trafficking, lots of really ugly and awful stuff. My life nearly ended many times during this time. As much as I try to grow up and get over it, I do carry a lot of pain from this time in my life. 1.5 years ago I left that life behind and moved 2,000+ miles away from the city I was living in to a very remote area where I ended up later meeting my fiancé. \n\nMy relationship with my mother is what I would describe as pretty drama-and-conflict-riddled. She has a lot of mental health issues (and likely still addiction problems, sadly) and generally has a very low view of me. She is extremely judgmental of others (she has BPD and in the past a court-ordered therapist suggested she has 'narcissistic tendencies' but I am not an expert here) and nearly every interaction with her leaves me feeling about two inches tall. I also technically still owe her somewhere around $800 that she 'gave me' over a period of time 7 years ago when I was homeless, which I had sort of forgotten about until about six months ago so that is a constant source of stress because now I have to worry about paying that back in addition to financially preparing for baby.\n\nI would like to tell my siblings about my pregnancy, even though we're not super close these days. However, I feel bad asking them to keep it a secret from our mom. And I know that at some point I'll have to tell her—it seems sort of ridiculous to just keep it from her until I pop our little bean out, I guess. I just know that telling her will result in her making me feel ashamed and awful and anxiety-ridden about the future (even though my fiance and I love our little family already). BTW, fiance's family is stoked that I'm pregnant and very supportive. It just makes me kind of sad that I have absolutely no bio family I can share this with because they'd just tell me to abort my baby. Should I wait until I'm further along to tell them? Any advice from folks who have delt with similar situations is more than welcome! Might delete this later as I feel pretty bad airing my dirty laundry like this lol.",

      "content": "EDIT: I went ahead and changed my OB to a different doctor and facility across town. I’m hoping I receive much better care and the nurse sounded supportive and caring. Thanks everyone for answering, you’ve all been helpful. \n\nAlso I haven’t smoked thc since I hit 4 weeks, I’m almost 10 weeks pregnant now. I see that question a lot. \n\nBurner account. \n\nI’ve been having complications with my blood pressure being low. This has led to numerous OB appointments already. Also, I gave birth almost a year ago which is relevant to this situation.\n\nI had my first official OB appointment where I was drug tested. I live in California, weed is legal for ages 21+, I’m over the age minimum. My test came back positive for thc.\n\nMy OB referred me to their in office diversion program.\n\nI had a consultation with the social worker on Tuesday over the phone which was odd because it was a federal holiday. The conversation was intrusive and condescending. She asked about my boyfriend, my children, and why I didn’t test positive for thc last year while I was pregnant and why I tested positive this time.\n\nI had no words. How would I know? I stop smoking whenever I find out I’m pregnant. The social worker then asked if I would like to continue with my pregnancy and I told her my boyfriend isn’t interested in continuing my pregnancy and that’s when the social worker suggested I speak with the abortion team to set up a chemical termination. She immediately reached out to the team who handles abortions and scheduled me an appointment. She starts going on about the benefits of termination and how I’m doing the right thing because my baby is under a year old. I don’t want to terminate my pregnancy.\n\nIs this standard procedure if I’ve been drug tested once in the first trimester? Do social workers typically suggest and encourage termination? I ended up canceling the appointment and filing a grievance with my health care provider. Has anyone else been through this?",

I didn't plan about getting sterilized initially, but when it was confirmed I'd get a planned c-section for the second baby, it just occurred to me that as they would be cutting me up anyway, wouldn't it be convenient to get this thing sorted out for good at the same time. I raised the issue during one of my prenatal appoinments and that's how the process begun.\n\n\nThis was six years ago. There was no extra cost, it had no effect on my recovery, and all-in-all, I'm very happy with everything.\n\n\nYou probably know that in Finland getting yourself sterilized is not.. encouraged? I needed to discuss about it with a doctor (twice if I recall correctly), who then made a formal decision to grant this to me. I needed to sign a form stating I really wanted it and understood it would not be reversed if later I'd come to regret it. \n\n\nSterilization is something that is expected to be had maybe a bit later in life, after a few kids, and as said, the public system will not offer help in conceiving again after such a thing is done. My conversations with the doctor covered these topics. It was also brought up as a risk that people would very likely come to regrets if your kids or new the baby were lost. \n\n\nI got to choose between clamping the tubes or cutting them. The pros and cons for both options were discussed.\n\n\nIn the end, I feel that after the decision from both my and the doctor's part was confirmed, the act itself was considered as a rather minor thing and there was absolutely no problems in adding it to the c-section work plan. Still, it was confirmed several times in a tick-the-box manner that this was still in my wishes and should be done, but that did not bother me one bit. As it is such a final procedure, I think that was a responsible and respectful manner of approach.\n\n\nPlease feel free to ask anything!",

But was quickly reassured he wasn't. But atm he seems to be handling it OK. He was out of character when with his dad though, texting me and talking about/mentioning me a LOT which is unusual for him when with dad.\n\nI have text the step mum “Hi Zoe,  I'm sorry to hear about you and Max. I wanted to reach out and say that if ever you want see  you're more than welcome to, but no pressure.\"\n\nI have messaged the school. \n\n[My son is about to experience something BIG –I'm scared. (ex) step-parent advice welcome\n\nMy son’s dad, Max, left when our son was five months old after a six-year relationship. Our son has never known us together. Max got together with Zoe a few weeks after leaving me, and our son has known Zoe since he was about a year old. Max and Zoe later got married.\n\nFast forward twelve years: I received a text from Max last week saying that he and Zoe are separating. I won’t lie—I cried, mostly for my son and his half-sister, who is six. Max plans to tell our son in person this Saturday. My son is ND so he doesn’t react in typical ways. I’m worried about how he might respond and how I can best support him. He tends to hold in his worries/feelings/thoughts and only releases them sporadically, which could be months later.\n\nI’m considering whether I should inform his school about the upcoming change. I think I should.\n\nI’m also concerned about whether he will continue to see Zoe. From my experience, step-parents never stay in the child’s life. You divorce spouses, not children, but ive never seen that put into practice. She has been part of his life for twelve years, since a baby, so I'm hopeful. If she reaches out asking to see him, I would say yes, but I’m unsure whether I should initiate contact or wait for her to do so.\n\nWe are all adults and have maintained a civil relationship, which I hope will help our son navigate this change as smoothly as possible.]",

Sometimes I'm just stepping away to either do the dishes or use the bathroom. Not up to 5 minutes but immediately I'm gone she bursts into tears like I have abandoned her forever.\n\nI’ve tried to sit beside the playpen so she can see me, giving her toys, even putting one of my shirts in there for comfort but it doesn’t really work. She clings to the side and cries and cries until I pick her up again.\n\nThe weird part is, she’s totally fine when other people hold her or when she’s on the floor crawling around. It’s just the playpen. I don’t know if it’s separation anxiety or if she just associates it with being “stuck.”\n\nI’ve read a few articles after scrolling through some random Alibaba listings at 2 a.m Some part of me thought that maybe this playpen was just old. I don't know but nothing really says what to do when they won’t stay in it at all.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this phase? Does it pass on its own or should I try something different? I’m honestly just trying to keep her safe and still have enough time to eat breakfast and do other stuff like a human being.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit : Thank you so much for all the replies  ❤️",

I will not let you harm the baby.\" And then like, idk put him in the room and stand next to the baby gate so he cant get out. Put him in the bathroom for up to but no more than 5 minutes if thats the only door you can keep him behind. Obviously these things require not needing to attend to the baby for a good 10-15 minutes but. Whatever can be done.

      "content": "I’m a first time mom and my daughter just started crawling like two weeks ago and I swear she's trying to give me a heart attack. She goes straight for the most dangerous stuff - electrical outlets, the stairs, our dog's food bowl. Yesterday I turned around for literally five seconds to grab my phone and she was halfway to the fireplace. We already baby-proofed the house - outlet covers, cabinet locks, gates on the stairs, the whole deal. But she still finds things to get into and I can't follow her around 24/7. I've decided to get a baby play pen but our budget is pretty tight since I'm on maternity leave, so I need to be smart about what we buy. I've been comparing different options online and the variety is overwhelming but I’ve narrowed it down to Graco, Summer Infant, and Baby Trend. Some basic mesh ones run about $60-80, then there's the Regalo My Play which is around $100, and those fancy North States Superyard systems that cost $150-200+. Even found some suppliers on Alibaba selling similar setups cheaper. I just want to clarify some things:\n\nWhich style actually works better for active babies - mesh kit, wooden panels, or plastic?\n\nHow long can I realistically use it before she outgrows it or figures out how to escape?\n\nMy daughter is super active and determined, so I need something that'll actually contain her safely while I do basic things like make coffee or fold laundry. She's not the type to sit quietly so I need something that'll keep her safe while I pee or make coffee without having to strap her in every time.\n\nThanks.",

Nothing you care about in any drawers. Small things out of the way. Baby gates at the entrances/exits. I don't believe 100% bubble room is the answer - we leave the coffee table out without any bumpers. Can kids hit their heads on the corner? Sure. They will get a bruise, it will be fine. But my baby proof areas are safe enough that no one is gonna die while I'm not looking. \n\n Now that we have 3 kids, our whole main floor is about this level of baby proof. We have chosen to adjust our environment rather than limit the kids. Then again, you might have a bigger space than we do. Our house is 1000 sq ft and blocking off a play pen area really gets in the way.",

      "title": "Postpartum Depression — Looking for Kind Advice ❤️",
      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m reaching out because I was recently \nconfirmed with postpartum depression, and I’m trying to understand myself better while figuring out how to communicate with my partner. I’d really appreciate kind and gentle advice.\n\nMy baby girl is 5.5 months old. For the past few months, I’ve been experiencing intense mood swings — I can feel loving and calm one moment, and then suddenly irritated or overwhelmed the next. It’s like a switch flips, and I can’t control it. It’s been draining for both me and my partner.\n\nOne major trigger for me is house cleanliness and tidiness, especially in the morning. I feel like I have to vacuum, clean the baby’s play area, tidy all her toys, and make sure everything is perfect before I can mentally start the day. We have a small dog too, so I’m constantly thinking about fur or mess. If I can’t finish this routine — or if taking care of the baby interrupts it — I get stuck and my whole day becomes mentally heavier.\n\nMy partner is incredibly supportive and truly tries his best. But even then, there are moments where I still feel unhappy or dissatisfied with how things are done. I know he’s helping, I appreciate him deeply, and I don’t want to feel this way… but sometimes my mood just takes over. Afterwards, I feel guilty and scared that I’m ruining our relationship or creating stress in our home. I don’t want that — I love my family.\n\nAnother layer to this is that we are both expats, living in a country without any family support. No grandparents, siblings, or relatives to help or give us a break. We also don’t have daycare. So every responsibility — house chores, baby care, emotional load — is just between the two of us, nonstop.\n\nI recently returned to full-time work (WFH) two weeks ago, and things became even harder. Balancing work, house chores, and the baby pushed me past what I could handle. After talking to my manager, I’ve decided to extend my leave due to mental health. It’s a relief but also makes me think deeply about how we should reorganize our routines.\n\nI would love to hear from parents in similar situations:\n\t•\tHow do you and your partner divide house chores and baby responsibilities, especially with no family support?\n\t•\tIf you’re a full-time working parent, how do you manage the balance?\n\t•\tIf one of you is a stay-at-home parent, what routines or agreements help keep things fair?\n\t•\tHow do you communicate your needs and triggers without sounding like you’re blaming your partner?\n\t•\tAny tips for managing “cleanliness anxiety” when things can’t be perfect?\n\t•\tAnd how do you cope with the guilt when your mood doesn’t match your intentions?\n\nI’m genuinely trying my best, and I want to create a calmer, healthier emotional space for myself and my family. Any kind advice, stories, or gentle guidance would mean a lot.\n\nThank you for reading 💛",

We decided we were going to try and have a second baby. It would be hard, but we’d do it. Shortly after making that decision, we all got Covid and had to isolate in our house for a week. We very quickly changed our minds.\n\nTime passed and the idea of a second child felt like it was always lingering at the back of my mind. But I was scared. Worried about my mental health, the impact on our existing child, lots of things. Then last year my husband and I had a discussion and I said I wanted to try to have a second child and that I didn’t want to regret not having another baby because I was scared. First cycle, I was pregnant.\n\nIt has been hard. I got PPA and PPD for a second time. But our baby is wonderful and we are very happy as a family of four. I never considered having three and I just feel that our family is complete. During the hard days/phases I relish thinking that I’ll never have to do this again. I feel relief when I sell the baby things she has outgrown like the bassinet. It’s bitter sweet packing away or donating her little clothes as she outgrows them, not because I want another baby, but because I would love to hold my tiny newborns again and experience that wonder while not also recovering from birth and dealing with anxiety and depression.",

We’ve been sick once before, for about a week we all got a cold but she was a champ. Never got a fever just lots of congestion and a tiny cough that lasted a few days. We would be traveling from a big international airport - is it not worth the risk? However, my husband HAS to go so whatever is out there might make its way to us anyway if he were to get sick ?\n\nI know people say they won’t remember days from this early but I think she could still have fun and we don’t really see not remembering as a reason to not give her fun experiences now.\n\nDoes anyone have experience traveling with a baby this young specially to a cold place?

(For 5ish mins only or until you only get little drops) I used to get my partner to do his top up feed/burp him when he stopped needing the top ups. \n\n- pump on the side the baby is not eating on or use a Hakka, helps save time.  I wasn’t particularly successful with this but know a few people who got loads from a Hakka. \n\n- Oats are good for milk production, I used to make sticky flapjacks and cut them into bite side pieces to eat while I was feeding. \n\n- be careful about how much you are pumping, over production is no joke! \n\n- heat pads are good for helping move blockages. \n\n- silver nipple shields are amazing! Especially for chapped nipples and making you feel a bit like Xena: warrior Princess!\n\n- If you’re ever concerned talk to your midwife or breastfeeding support (there are some good charities out there) they are there to help.",

So if you do nurse, you don't need to keep to that 3-hrly pumping intervals. I believe the guidance is to have milk removed every 3h intervals, be it latching or pumping. \n\nAnd if you can't keep to that either, hey that's totally fine. Self-care, feeding yourself, and sleep - all these are important to your milk supply too. \n\nLastly, hydrate!",

      "content": "My daughter turned 1 last month and she’s the light of my life. I would say she’s been a pretty easy baby for the most part. She’s in great health, thank God, and she’s a curious, smart, funny, little toddler now. I know I’m biased, but she’s everything I have wished for in a child. My marriage has become stronger since having her and I feel like our family is perfect. With this, the thought is in the back of my head whether we want a second. I know it’s still early, but people are already asking if we want another. My husband is from a different culture than me and there is a huge pressure to have a lot of kids. Emphasis on huge. I really don’t know how to respond to people’s questions so I say, I don’t know yet. Truthfully, I don’t really have a desire to have another child. I just don’t feel it. I might change my mind in the future, but the thought of only having my daughter feels so appealing. I’m 31 and we could have more, but I just don’t know. I only know a handful of people who are only children and I’ve gotten very mixed reviews. Some hated it, some loved it. My thoughts-\n\n1. I’ve had health issues my whole life and, not surprisingly, my pregnancy was difficult. Gestational diabetes, blood thinner injections, a traumatic birth, NICU, lots of me crying- it was not ideal. If I have another baby, I would have to go through GD and blood thinner injections again. I was also advised to have a c-section (which I’m really not enthusiastic about). \n\n2. My husband and I are high income, but we’re swimming in student loan debt.  We’re aggressively paying it off but it’s going to be at least 4 years before it’s all gone. We’re renting an apartment that we love, but having 2 kids here wouldn’t be comfortable. It’s already tight with just one child. Buying a house is not in the cards for us right now, so if we did have another it would have to be here. It’s doable, but it wouldn’t be a fun living situation.\n\n3. I also worry about the cost of living going up, the rising price of education and college… the rising price of everything to be honest. I feel like I would rather have less financial stress and just give her everything we can? I also worry about our world in general (politically, environmentally, etc.) which makes me hesitate having another.\n\nMy husband and I play with her all the time and we genuinely love being parents. I feel like we’re the three musketeers and I don’t want to fuck that up and add more to our plate. I know having a sibling would give her a companion, but we’re close to family and she will have a lot of cousins to play with? I’ve thought about the option of adopting, but I’m not sure about that either. The companion piece is really the only pro I can think about. My husband said he’s always wanted multiple, but he’s open to the idea of having one. Someone please give me their experience and input. I would greatly appreciate it 🥲💓 TIA!",

          "body": "So my daughter was an only child for 5 years. We were never planning on having another one, she was very difficult as a baby, she had a lot of minor medical needs and the transition into parenthood was honestly a nightmare. Labor was also just traumatic for me. We were completely happy with it just being us 3, we really loved the idea. \n\nWell, birth control doesn't always work. My 2nd pregnancy was completely different from my first, which was a breeze. It was rough pretty much all to the way through, and afterwards, I developed graves disease from it, which just added another layer of stress. We got really lucky because my son was the easiest baby we could ask for. It all worked out for us, I'm very happy it worked out the way it did because it could have gone south at any point. I don't think I'd ever regret either of my kids, but I was extremely worried about the financial implications of two children. We're definitely at our limit. \n\nI got my tubes removed, we're not taking any chances again. But I can honestly say that while I'm really happy I have my son, I would have been completely fine if it were just my daughter. She has like 15+ cousins and counting, 8 uncles, 2 aunts, plus their partners. She will be loved regardless. Adjusting to not being an only child was a struggle for her at first, I think her life would likely have been easier if she didn't have to share our attention. She loves her brother so much, though, so she doesn't notice anymore and we make a very intentional effort to focus on her. It's hard some days, but we make it work. It is absolutely not for everyone. \n\nI truly don't understand how people do it with more kids. My husband's Mom had 8 kids (hell no!) and she raised most of them by herself. They were very poor and missed out on a lot of things, but surprisingly, 7/8 turned out very well for what they had to deal with. My MIL doesn't want to be included in a lot because she is over being responsible for kids, which is just another reason why I'm glad we only have 2. If mine decide to have kids, I will have the energy to give them if they ever need help. \n\nI think you should make the best choice for your health. If it isn't safe to carry another baby, there's no question. But if it is safe and you actually want it for YOU, I don't think you'll regret it. But it has to be for you and not your kid. It's definitely something to put a lot of thought into.",

So we’ve got this dynamic now where I’m correcting her All. The. Time. whether it’s behavior at home or just trying to get her to act appropriately in public, and I feel like it’s… crushing her? \n\nShe’s much shyer than she was previously, even with people she knows well. At home it just feels like I’m telling her no constantly and she feels like she can’t do anything. (Some of her favorite activities include jumping off the bed right next to her brother on the floor, dancing in circles around the kitchen while he’s crawling around, etc. Not to mention the purposeful hurting.)\n\nAnd I keep coming back to, well, I can’t stop correcting entirely, because she could really injure her brother. But she often does things because she knows it gets a reaction from me.\n\nI know this can all be really normal, but I keep thinking of my own mother who was very concerned about how we acted in public and at home and was basically “at war” with my sister for several years because she couldn’t get her to act right. My sister’s memories of those years are just my mother yelling at her all the time. \n\nI don’t yell much, but I do feel like there’s more correction and stern looks than connection, and despite my attempts to create it (running errands just us, focusing on special time while baby’s napping, etc.), it still feels like something’s broken. I am just looking for some words of wisdom I guess.",

How about you jump over here away from LG?” I also make sure to redirect LG when he’s waiving his hands around and hits BG or accidentally grabs BG’s hair, “oh no LG! You have to be nice to BG! Let go of his hair!” And sometimes if it’s bad and BG cries I help LG do the sign for sorry. \n\nIf I can’t keep an eye on them when I’m cooking or doing dishes and I think BG is amped up and LG might get hurt then I put LG in his baby cage to keep them separate. It’s just a mesh playpen area that has some toys in it and they’re usually happy with the separation. \n\nIt’s really hard to not be reactive and immediately respond every time there’s a chance your 3 year old does something around your 8 month old but all of you including the kiddos need to learn their limits and what’s appropriate. Some things can be ok like dancing around him in the kitchen whereas others can be more dangerous like jumping near him but the big ones don’t know where the line is. And the little ones are really more durable than we think. Today BG pushed LG over in their room and LG just laughed over being on his back while I expected him to start crying. I still told BG to be gentle and nice but I didn’t have to put him in timeout since they were playing. \n\nHope this helps! Everyone’s kids are different and we are all trying to do our best!

          "body": "The global [Baby Diapers Market](https://www.millioninsights.com/industry-reports/baby-diapers-market/request-sample?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sunilR_24May21) size is anticipated to reach USD 64.62 by 2022, progressing at a CAGR of 6.2% over the forecast period. Rising consciousness towards baby health and affordability of the baby care products are the major driving force which is presumed to boost the industry in the coming future.\r  \n\r  \nAdvancement in science and technology has given rise to several outstanding products with various properties that have contributed to the market penetration, mostly in the developing region. A significant increase in the number of working women especially in developing parts of the globe has had a growing impact on product sales due to the easy to use the property as well as convenience factor of the product.\r  \n\r  \nConsumer’s increasing disposable income has resulted in higher buying power mostly in the developing region. Such increments are expected to raise the sales of premium products in the market which in turn will trigger the global baby diaper industry shortly. The high rate of birth in the developing regions such as the Middle East &amp; Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America is another major factor that is expected to impact the regional product sales positively.\r  \n\r  \nContinuous exposure to chemicals caused by disposable baby diapers leads to skin rashes and many other negative health impacts. Increasing awareness towards these toxic chemicals and their negative impact on health are most likely to influence the baby diapers market negatively over the upcoming seven years.\r  \n\r  \nStrict government regulation as well as private agencies to safeguard customer interest is liable to obstruct industry growth shortly. Initiatives taken by R&amp;D to build superior products without adverse impacts on health assures some growth opportunities for the industry. Several markets in the developing region have little awareness about the baby diapers. Such markets are anticipated to provide many opportunities for the participants in the industry. Growth in e-commerce sector recently is expected to drive the market penetration opportunities over the forecast period.\r  \n\r  \n**Product Insights**\r  \n\r  \nThe key products include disposable diapers, biodegradable diapers, cloth diapers, swim diapers and training nappy. The global market is dominated by the disposable ones among all the other products, and this trend is anticipated to continue over the forecast period. Cloth based products and training pants emerged as the third and second major segments in the recent past.\r  \n\r  \nBiodegradable diapers are expected to experience a rapid growth rate over the forecast period owing to the increasing awareness towards the environment and changing consumer preference. Industry’s other cloth-based products include Pre-fold, flat and all-in-one. Increasing ill effects of the chemicals used in disposable diapers is projected to incline consumer towards the cloth-based products in the upcoming future.\r  \n\r  \nDisposable diaper segment includes various types of products such as super absorbent disposables, ultra-absorbent disposables, bio-degradable disposables and regular disposables. Ultra-absorbent disposables and Super absorbent disposable products are anticipated to dominate the global market over the forecast period.\r  \n\r  \n**Regional Insights**\r  \n\r  \nThe global baby diapers market was dominated by Europe during the past few years, followed by North America and Asia-Pacific. Due to slow birth rate in the developed region such as Europe and North America growth rate is expected to be moderate in such regions. Developing economies such as India and China is anticipated to lead the market in the Asia Pacific region due to the factors involving high birth rates, easy affordability, increasing disposable income as well as Rising awareness towards baby health.\r  \n\r  \nOther parts such as Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East are expected to experience the high demand as well. However, certain countries in Africa are projected to lag the regional industry owing to the factors such as overall economic poverty as well as little awareness towards baby health issues.\r  \n\r  \n**Competitive Insights**\r  \n\r  \nThe major industry participants have captured more than 50% of the global market. These companies have been strategically planning the acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships with an aim to build superior products and enhance the production capacity and thereby increase the market penetration. Key players in the industry include P&amp;G, Hengan, SCA, Cotton babies, Kimberly-Clark, KAO, Phillips Health care, Unicharm, The Honest Co, Drylock, OsoCozy, First Quality, Hain Celential, Ontex, SCA and Seventh Generation. \r  \n\r  \n**Market Segment:**\r  \n\r  \nGlobal Baby Diapers Product Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2012 - 2022)\r  \n• Cloth Diapers\r  \n• Flat cloth diapers\r  \n• Fitted cloth diapers\r  \n• Pre-fold cloth diapers\r  \n• All-in-one cloth diapers\r  \n• Other\r  \n• Disposable Diapers\r  \n• Ultra absorbent disposable diapers\r  \n• Regular disposable diapers\r  \n• Super absorbent disposable diapers\r  \n• Bio-degradable disposable diapers\r  \n• Training Nappy\r  \n• Swim Pants\r  \n• Biodegradable Diapers\r  \n\r  \nGlobal Baby Diapers Regional Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2012 - 2022)\r  \n• North America\r  \n• Europe\r  \n• Asia Pacific\r  \n• Latin America, Middle East &amp; Africa (LAMEA)",

I'd get a case of 96 diapers and the case of 100 boosters.\n\nThat being said, for close to the same price you can put yourself in a far.better diaper at www.NorthShoreCare.com . A case of Betterdry or Crinklz--which are essentially the same diaper--may only have 60 diapers but the performance outstrips the ATN and one of those is worth a few ATNs.\n\nIf you buy 4 individual bags of Supremes, that also gives you 30 diapers (Though the smaller sizes come in cases of 4.) Those perform just as well.\n\nI think 4 bags of the mighty Megamax comes out to 40 diapers and their performance is better than the others.\n\nYou choice comes down to how much you go #2. If it's.more than twice a day, the Megamax is overkill. Three or four times a day is a good range for the Betterdry or Supreme.",

I would always ask my mom for them and most the time she would give in to my demands. Later on she had me talk to a psychologist about my \"obsession\" which he assured her it was harmless and \"normal\" to be into this. This was all pre internet days so i felt like I was a freak the only one in the world that was into doing this. Once the internet came around I quickly found groups of people just like me that wanted to and enjoyed the comfort of wearing diapers. The hardest part of my whole journey so far was telling my wife when we started dating like hey I got this thing that helps me shut the world off. She was and still is very understanding of it we set some simple rules which are very simple to follow. But she knows about it from time to time asks questions about it because of being curious but will never participate which is ok I'm fine with it. It has taken me pretty much my whole life to get to this point only regret I have is not being allowed to be me sooner. When did you know you were into diapers?",

About 9 months ago, shortly into our relationship he gave me a dare to buy some Tena lady's, thinking I wouldn't I did and put one on. I now know this is where it started. From what I can gather he looked further into it and it became a fetish. It was only when we moved in together and I went on his computer I saw he was looking at diaper porn, pics of women wearing them, clearly for his pleasure. I confronted him and we discussed it and I looked it up online. We stayed together and to a degree I accepted it. I started to participate, he said it blew his mind. He's always been great with me and so thoughtful in the bedroom dept and it wasn't always fetish play although I feel he wanted it more. I've always had an issue with him watching stuff and looking at stuff online, but he promised that would stop. We have been great for ages. He said about wetting diapers, I couldn't do it but if I went on the toilet I could and he seemed ok with this. I had to go on his computer this morning and couldn't help checking what he looked at... videos of girls dirtying there diapers (pooing) I blew my top with him and now I really don't know what to think or do. I don't know how I feel about that, I know I'm so upset he's been looking again and lied to me. I honestly don't know if this is something I can do, or accept and don't know what to say to him. We are going to talk tonight but I don't know what to do, i am looking for advise if anyone has been in a similar situation? I love the bones of him, but surely there has to be a limit to what one can do and accept. Thanks in advance x",

What I found worked really well was taking a fresh plastic shopping bag, cutting the handles and sides down to the bottom of the bag, then laying it flat and layering a bunch of paper towels down the middle of it. This makes a quick and relatively easy DIY disposable! \n\nFor putting it on, take some tape (packing tape works great) and place 1-2 strips along both sides and adjust until you're comfortable.\n\nA couple notes: \n\n-Make sure the shopping bag is recent and doesn't have any holes in it (for obvious reasons).\n\n-I personally preferred 1/2 - 1/3 of a paper towel roll and of course this part can be adjusted to your liking.",

Who happens to have a really difficult assignment coming up and needs some help from you guys.\n\nLast year I was assigned to a music festival that lasts almost 16 hours. During that time I got maybe 3 bathroom breaks total. We're a small company and our resources are stretched pretty thin, and our manpower isn't very large.\n\nThe summer gets between 94-100 degrees here, and I have to stay super well hydrated because my job is literally standing in the sun for 4-5 hours at a time, but with so few breaks, it's difficult to both stay safely hydrated without ending up holding painful/uncomfortable full bladders for hours on end.\n\nWhich is why this year, I want to be ready.\n\nDo you guys have any recommendations for a brand of adult diaper that would best suit this kind of assignment?\n\nThanks in advance. I know this is a strange request... but I appreciate any input.\n\nMy parameters are:\n-Stationary, long-term standing security work\n-probably going to have to pee about 3-4 times in a single diaper\n-hot environment\n-preferably not have to explain to my coworkers/customers why I look like I'm wearing a diaper.\nThank you all so much... please don't judge me",

It’s all fine between us, and I think she’ll look more like him as she gets older (I see hints in her facial features, and I think once she finally grows some hair it will be dark). \n\nBut people are constantly commenting to him that she looks nothing like him. It’s fine coming from family and friends who are just genuinely saying a true and somewhat surprising fact. But even acquaintances comment on it, and he gets the feeling (true or not, idk) that they are wondering if his sweet baby is actually his. He told me yesterday that he sometimes doesn’t even want to show people her pictures because he doesn’t want to feel judged by some random coworker he barely knows. It breaks my heart because I know he’s so proud of her; he is constantly showing her off to family and friends.\n\nLike, c’mon people! Just don’t say crap like that. Not every thought is an outside thought! 🤬",

      "title": "Being a mom is hard, and not because of the baby",
      "content": "It's been an especially challenging week for both myself and the baby. She's been going through a developmental leap, and possibly yet another growth spurt. So her appetite has been huge, and she's been constantly active, then getting fussy and tired out more quickly because of it.  \n  \nI do my best to maintain her routine, but my partner's mom is inclined to throw it all out the window. She often likes to stop by unannounced just to see the baby and bring over whatever new clothes she found. She likes to play dress up with the baby and change her outfit that we already put on her for the day which makes more laundry for us.  \n  \nShe likes to ignore what I say and do the opposite, like when I tell her the baby is tired she just stimulates her more until she gets fussy because she's overstimulated. Then I have to deal with calming her down to get her to sleep.  \n  \nShe likes to talk to the baby rather than talk directly to myself or my partner. Like today, instead of asking me anything, she asks the baby, \"Do you need a nappy? Have you had your bubba yet?\" Even though I was feeding the baby RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER when she arrived, and I had already told her the baby is tired.  \n  \nWhat bothers me more about this is my partner not really backing me up in all of this. His mom has been stopping by unannounced since before I even got pregnant because she's retired, she doesn't have many friends or they're still working or married and busy, and she gets lonely. I've explained to my partner before that I like to know when someone is going to stop by so I can at least mentally prepare but he doesn't see what the big deal is. Or like today, when I kept telling both of them she was tired, he tells me she had a pretty good nap in the morning with him and she slept for a while. But I don't go by the last time she napped or how long she napped but by her cues. And she was yawning before, so she's tired.  \n  \nI just sometimes feel invisible, and it's especially frustrating because when people don't listen to me, it's not me that suffers but the baby. They ignore when she's tired and keep her awake when all she wants to do is sleep. Or they assume they know what she wants when they don't. Especially the older generations who had kids decades ago. They seem to have forgotten what it's like to raise a baby and think it's no big deal, but it's exhausting in every sense of the word.  \n  \nBut it's not because of the baby, but because of everyone else.",

Well, he’s not a fan of the car. He can tolerate it for like 10-15 minutes then he’s OVER IT (and thats per day,\nSo if we go somewhere thats 15 min away, he’ll cry the whole way back) My husband or I have ridden in the back seat with him since he was born and when he cries we hand him toys, play him songs, entertain him, etc. today we were driving about 20 min away and he started fussing. Some light crying, just getting frustrated. My husband was in the back and started gearing up to play baby beluga, was handing him toy after toy, making faces, when i had a little bit of a realization that maybe that wasnt the best move anymore? Am I teaching him that he can yell and he’ll be entertained in the car? Should i let him be bored and annoyed about it? The car is boring but its a necessary evil. I’m not proud to say ive done some crazy maneuvers to hand him binkies and toys while driving with him alone. \n\nOn the way home i sat in the passenger seat with my husband for the first time in almost half a year and we played music and gave him 1 toy which he threw. He cried, never escalated to sobs or real tears. We talked to him calmly and he just stopped fussing eventually! Maybe like 8 minutes of fussing. \n\nMy husband said it felt like we were doing cry it out - car edition. \n\nI dont want him to be traumatized by the car but its also not safe for me to be trying to keep him happy while going places, and its hard on my mental health to be afraid to go places alone because of it.\n Thoughts?",

He’s an infant, all he has is his ability to cry, and responding to that communication builds your connection and his trust and attachment. So it’s never a bad thing to respond to a child. \n\nLater, when he’s older, there are way more nuances that they learn so unless you are spoiling a child rotten they get that they can’t cry and get what they want all the time. It comes as they develop. They learn to wait, they learn to cope, they understand what boundaries you’re setting. \n\nBut at 5 months, just keep the car ride as painless as possible for everyone and that means entertaining the baby. \n\nThere’s also a flip side however in that sometimes, you can’t. Sometimes he’s gonna cry in the car and you are further ahead just letting him to do it, let him burn himself out. Even at home, sometimes that kid is going to cry for 3 minutes while I finish up dinner. \n\nDon’t think your job is to stop his crying all the time, because it’s not, and sometimes nothing works and you’ll get more worked up. Babies cry, it’s their job. We respond when we can, as much as we can, but we also know that sometimes we can’t. And you might be like hey actually in the car it’s better to just ignore him and let him stop crying. And that’s fine. If he gets more and more worked up you’ll know.",

I’ve always been open to kids but never dreamed of having many. He told me he wanted a big family (5) later in the relationship, because in the beginning he felt the same way I did - open to it, but it wasn’t a big deal. I always said I didn’t want 5, but was open to 3 and maybe 4, it was hard to say since we didn’t have any. \n\nFast forward to now, we have a wonderful little baby whom we both adore. Although I love being her mom, being a mom is very difficult with no support system whatsoever, and I’ve had to give up a lot to be with her at home. On the topic, I asked him “what if I only wanted 2?” (Not that I necessarily only want 2, but you never know how life will go). And he said he’d probably leave me and find someone who wanted more kids, because “life is short” and he wants a big family no matter what. I understand that a big family is important to him, but I am the one carrying, birthing, and feeding our children and when he so blatantly said that I felt like nothing but a replaceable baby pushing object. We love each other and have a great marriage, but that stung. I did talk to him about it right away and said I felt replaceable and it made me feel like our marriage stood at a very weak place in his priorities. I couldn’t believe his first thought was to throw away the family we have (and I do want more kids) because of that. I understand how he feels in terms of wanting more, but the way he answered caught me so off guard. I told him it actually made me less open to even giving him more children, since if I didn’t do what he wanted he’d leave me stranded. \n\nWe already talked about it and he apologized and said that he didn’t mean it and wouldn’t actually leave me, but I’ve been carrying this for a few weeks now and I can’t seem to let go of the heaviness of it all.

Was this an accident…? Or could he have potentially messed with your birth control? (I know it sounds crazy but unfortunately it happened to my own aunt after she wanted to stop at 3 and her icky husband wanted more) \n\n3) does help with the baby? You said that you have no support system and that you’ve given up a lot. Has he given things up too? Do you spend equal time caring for the baby and home? Do you spend equal time on hobbies or seeing friends? \n\n4) he has now clearly stated that he wants a large family and it’s a massive priority for him. You seem on the fence. Would you be open to compromising and having more? If not, this might be an impasse that needs addressing sooner rather than later. If you are open, what would it take for you to want to have 4+ children? \n\n5) can he afford to support a large family and support you as the birth parent ( plus nursing, being primary parent, etc). What is he willing to do to accommodate you and prioritize your physical and mental heath in the next 10+ years? \n\nJust some things to think about before you make a decision and (hopefully) have a serious conversation with him about children, boundaries, priorities, and marriage. ❤️‍🩹",

The thing is, she only has this energy *because* she's social with other moms, *because* she has a support network, *because* she's only gained by leaning into her identity as a mom. She struggled with all of that prior to baby. So it breaks my heart when you say you don't have that, because my wife was that way and thankfully now she's not.\n\nAlso, how old is your baby?

Unfortunately my supply has dried up so I’ve been told by the pediatrician to switch to formula until she’s one. We discussed early weaning but the pediatrician felt strongly she should at least have some formula for a short time. I’m not sure if she doesn’t like the taste, but she won’t take a bottle of formula. I mixed it half with breastmilk but I only have four ounces remaining in the freezer so I can’t do that for much longer anyway. She eats solids great and I try to give her dairy as much as possible. Anyone been in a similar situation? I’m tempted to just try to wean and/or offer whole milks but I don’t want to go against the recommendations of her doctor who I totally trust. Or, any tips for getting formula into the diet?",

He was born at 8lbs 7oz and lost about a pound within just a few days after birth. This was obviously concerning and me, his pediatrician and the lactation consultant all figured out it was because of his severe tongue and lip tie. \n\nI have done so much to try and get him to gain weight especially within those first few weeks. I used nipple shields every feeding to help him latch better, I used syringes, I used Frida Baby Pacifier Syringe, I give him a bottle of breastmilk after he’s ate off of my breasts to help supplement every feeding. \n\nHe finally got his tongue and lip tie corrected last week at 3 weeks old and he immediately was able to latch and eat better. He still wasnt up to his birth weight yet as he was at 8lbs 3 oz by this point so his pediatrician wanted to see him again this week. \n\nHe is now 4 weeks old and he only gained one ounce within a week. Making him 8lbs 4oz. His pediatrician now wants to see him again in three days to see his progress and if he hasnt gained then I was told we would be sent to the hospital for testing. \n\nI did mention that I do believe he has reflux issues as he spits and throws up so much throughout the day and night. Its after feeding, two hours after feeding, multiple times. I’ve tried keeping him upright for 20-30 minutes after eating, he still vomits the second he’s laid down. He gets the hiccups frequently even when its been over an hour since he last ate. He cries and is extremely fussy when laying down in his bassinet. His pediatrician also prescribed reflux medication so we’ll see if that helps and if this is possibly another reason for the slow weight gain as he’s throwing up everything I feed him. \n\nI typically breastfeed him for 20 minutes, 10 minutes on each breast. Sometimes I go for 30 minutes. This is about every 2 hours, sometimes 2 hours and 30 minutes, throughout the day. Once its bedtime, he gets fed every 3 hours. He still has normal amounts of pee and recently, his poops decreased to about one big one every day. Which also has been contributing to his fussiness and crying. \n\nAnyone have any advice about what could be causing his slow weight gain? How concerning is this? Any tips on what I can do? Im starting to get worried and its getting so difficult on me. I do have my husband but since he’s gone back to work, Im barely sleeping because I feel bad about waking him up in the night to help so Im feeding and taking care of our son all day and all night aside from a few hours from when my husband gets off work and when we go to bed. I just want my son to get his weight up. He’s a seemingly healthy baby and has no issues besides this and his tongue/lip tie that was corrected.",

It won’t hurt anything. And I think it would make a huge difference. Once he gains and gets stronger you can drop the formula.\n\nEdit- but this is really really hard on one parent to do it all especially with the extra feeds. Your husband *has* to take a shift at night even though he’s working. You will burn out so fast, trust me. He can maybe take the baby from like 9-1AM and bring him to you for nursing, then he can offer a bottle, and hold the baby while you sleep. Really, don’t feel bad. He is a parent too.",

He was also colicky, but I know not all kids with faith allergies are. It took seeing fleks of blood in his stool at 5 weeks for his doctor to finally suggest that it could be a dairy allergy. I took all dairy out of my diet (it's a lot of reading labels and finding substitutes, and it sucks at first, but you get used to it), and getting a hypoallergenic formula (nutramigen) to supplement with. We did end up fortifying formula on our gastroenterologist's orders too. Within 2-3 days he was like a totally different baby. He was so much happier, slept better, it was amazing. When he was born he was right at the 50th percentile.  5 weeks he weighed in at the 2nd percentile, and by the time we got to 6 months old, he was in the 88th percentile.

When I’m in the thick of it some of these nights I feel so rage-y when he’s waking up again. Like I’m clenched, tense, angry for a moment until it just makes me cry and it passes. Crying definitely helps me release it. I hate it so much and it makes me feel like a bad mom and I don’t want the energy carrying over to him. In the morning when it all passes I can’t stop snuggling and kissing him and just tell him I’m sorry that I’m struggling and I know he can’t help it:( it’s just so hard.\n\nTo add - I do have great support from my husband and I decided it was best for him to sleep in a separate room so he’s rested to help me more and then he comes and takes the baby around 6am and I take a long good morning nap, and that’s what’s been getting me by. But after I’ve been fortunate enough to have 8 weeks with him home he’s returning to work in a couple days and this will all definitely be more limited and it just makes me nervous how I’ll cope with these emotions if his sleep doesn’t improve. My baby is obviously safe and I’d never act on this rage but it just makes me want to scream when I feel it and I feel so bad.",

It's better to try and work out why you're spending that money.\n\nYou're chasing the dopamine hit that comes from the novelty of buying those tiny cute clothes, but why? Really give it some thought. \n\nSomething else you can do is sit down with your bank statement and tally up how much you've spent on baby clothing over the past three months. It can be very confronting but helpful to kickstart change. I've done this to show myself that going to the supermarket during my lunch break each day to get a little treat was actually costing me an insane amount.\n\nLastly, you say that you buy these clothes after contributing your share to the necessities, then go on to say that you guys need to save. Saving IS a necessity. You absolutely need to be paying into your savings when you pay your bills. Set up an account that you can't touch unless you go into a bank or call them, or even just one that isn't linked to a card, then automate a set amount to be paid into it every time you get paid. It needs to be a non-negotiable. Plus when you take action that aligns with your goals and values, you'll get something even more valuable than short term dopamine hits: self-confidence and trust in yourself. You can do this.",

Keep doing it and when your milk does come in it will help you build your supply.\n\nJaundice is very common and not something you should feel guilty about.

Also got bloodwork done and I was low in iron and b12. \n\n- improved my diet to ensure whole foods and proper macro and micro nutrients \n\n- ensured at least 2l of water a day\n\n- got on proper supplements to fix deficiencies \n\n- got a blast of early morning sunlight \n\n- had a consistent wake up time\n\n- had a consistent wind down routine. It took a bit to figure out what worked but for me is was a warm drink and an episode of to call the midwife. \n\nOverall it took about 4ish months for my nervous system to regulate again and for sleep to consistently regulate. I’m now able to fall asleep quickly, and get back to sleep after baby wakes in the night! I hope you are able to get some help, insomnia is torture.",

For the first few days, I had absolutely no milk; my baby wouldn't take the breast and I cried every day for the first 15 days. It wasn't until day 10 after my baby was born that I finally got my first drops of colostrum, and by then my baby would cry every time I put him to the breast.  I hired a lactation consultant, and during her session, she had me give the formula with a syringe. This caused my baby to have a terrible gas colic—his first colic. That day, I decided I wasn't going to force breastfeeding anymore and started exclusively pumping. I've spent al lot of money on pumps and \"miracle\" remedies to increase milk production, but I never managed to get more than 10 ounces a day. I made peace with it, and I gave my baby what little I produced. Then he was diagnosed with cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA). Again, I started a strict diet and giving him only formula for a few weeks. Then I reintroduced my milk, and he was fine for a few days, but then the colic returned. I stopped breastfeeding again because I realized I had been consuming traces of milk in some candies. For 40 days, I've been on a strict diet. I don't eat fruits, vegetables, grains, seafood, bread, any processed foods, or dairy. Basically, my diet consists of eggs, rice or potatoes, and one animal protein.  The gastroenterologist told me to reintroduce my milk. He was fine, but today he has colic again, he doesn't want to eat. He just wants to cry. He's not calm. The only thing that's changed is my milk. At this point, I don't know if it's better to stop giving it to him. I've put so much effort into the diet and pumping, but it seems to be doing him more harm than good. My baby is 4 months old.",

A bit of eczema, always fussing and crying, seemed really uncomfortable. Two weeks ago I cut dairy and soy from my diet to see if that helped him. This past Wednesday was the two week mark and we saw no improvement, so I decided to try nutramigen. His poops are already significantly better, so we are just going to keep him on that and I’ll wean breastfeeding.\n\nWe went to the ped yesterday and he said that bc he’s doing so well on nutramigen already, that makes him think it’s a food allergy or possibly something a bit more serious because the response was so immediate. He mentioned FPIES, or possibly a gastro doing a scope? We are seeing the gastro on Wednesday, but I’m obviously freaked out by what could be wrong.\n\nAdditionally, baby used to coo and babble all the time before this came up. He laughs and giggles and smiles and blows bubbles and sometimes screeches, but him just laying there cooing doesn’t happen anymore. If he’s laying on the ground he’s usually fussing or crying, I’m assuming because he’s uncomfortable. Ped says he’s not concerned right now but by six months he would be, but that’s only two weeks away.\n\nMy questions are-\n\n-if your baby has a food allergy what was your process for figuring it out when they’ve only had breastmilk so far?\n-Could I know if he has fpies from breastmilk?\n-do you think I should be concerned with baby not cooing or babbling anymore at the age? Do you think it could have slowed because he’s uncomfortable? When did your baby really start making noises?",

I cut dairy and soy but 2 months later he still had moderate to severe eczema and would get hives randomly. Nutrimigan fixed most of the skin issues but the acid poops ruined his poor bottom and we battled a horrific diaper rash for about 10 days. We introduced PB at 6 months old and he reacted very poorly with huge red welts and hives all over his face after the first bite. Items with eggs baked into them made him vomit, so we added that to the list of things to avoid for now. EpiPen was prescribed by his pediatrician after the PB event. \n\nWe got in at an allergist about a month ago and she ordered bloodwork, which is being hung up by insurance at the moment. In the meantime we have been told to avoid peanuts, eggs, and dairy but continue to slowly introduce other allergens. Soy has been fine for us. Allergist gave some comforting numbers about the percentages of kids that will grow out of dairy and egg allergies by the time they’re two.\n\nDon’t expect any “quick” answers or magic tests. It’s a lot of trial and error, honestly, and it can be very upsetting to constantly be worried about what you’re feeding your kid. Especially when they become mobile. Mine almost swiped some scrambled eggs off another child’s tray at daycare a few weeks ago. \n\nRegarding the cooing/babbling - mine definitely cooed less around 6 months and then started making much more pointed noises but not as often. He’s probably trying to work on some of his other skills right now like crawling and sitting, so it seems pretty natural that he would take a break from his verbal skills.

One bump went away within the first month and the other bump has calcified and is still there, though it is smaller. \n\nIf you had a similar experience, did your baby’s bump eventually go away? \n\nOur pediatrician told us we could schedule an appointment with a cosmetic surgeon at our 4 month appointment if there were no changes in its size. I’m not too worried about it since it doesn’t affect him but hoping it will go away on its own.",

So he wants to quit his job and drive for uber in the mornings / early afternoons then be home by the time I leave for work so that he can keep the baby while I’m working and we won’t need child care.\n\nDaycares around here are expensive. I called one and they said they are $287 per week. A private sitter quoted me $225 per week. The cheapest I could find was $190 per week, and if it’s the cheapest I don’t know what the quality is like. So he can afford to take a pay cut if it means we’ll be saving money on day care. Plus our child won’t be exposed to sicknesses like hand-foot-mouth disease.\n\nI’m just sad because he works for a big company and I’m proud to say, “My husband works for XYZ,” when people ask. And I know my pride will take a hit if I need to start saying, “My husband drives for Uber.” But I need to get over that and let him do what’s best for the family. I need to not be so superficial.",

Not only have we been primed to expect our male partners to be the providers while we care for the family, it's also a huge paradigm shift to \"invert\" the roles and still retain your \"mommy-hood\" without invalidating your partner's own role as a main caretaker.\n\nI understand the queasy feeling of shame-but-not-quite when saying \"my husband is a stay at home dad\". The side eye from family and friends. The sadness of seeing his pride be hurt too, because he's worked all his life and he's being slighted by friends because of this choice.\n\nWe had to learn to be so, so kind to each other. We're still learning, to be honest, and it's almost been a full year. But we had no way of paying for childcare, and my salary was simply the bigger income for our household. He's an awesome dad though, and once I learned to let go and let him parent his way, things were a lot easier on everyone.\n\nIf you go this route, just remember that being a full time dad is an act of love, just as being a stay at home mom is. Don't deprive your partner of the respect others will withhold from him for defying societal roles. Try your hardest not to resent him for bonding with the baby more than you can. And finally, don't play into taking on the role of the typical household provider because man, that's a huge load and it's unbearable to shoulder it alone. Best of lucks for you and your family, things will work out eventually!!",

      "content": "Content warning just in case.\n\nMy daughter (9mo) was rushed into the emergency room two weeks ago with a fever of 41C (105.8F). On arrival, I was told that baby would need to immediately be put on fluids to bring her temperature down. The attending nurse then told me that I would be asked to leave the room when the drip was inserted. I tried to remain calm and to put my trust in the nurses and doctors to allow for a smoother process, so I obeyed. I left the room and stood outside. 3 additional nurses were called into the room to assist (apparently my daughter was putting up a fight and couldn’t be restrained). I listened to her scream her lungs out from the other side of the door for about 10 minutes, at which point I sent my husband in to make sure that everything was okay. By the time they were done, bedding needed to be changed because her blood was all over the place. She was exhausted and passed out on my shoulder the moment I picked her up. Our worst experience to date.\n\nI’d just like to know - is it standard practice for mothers to be asked to leave the room when IV drips are being administered on babies? Or was it a decision based on how myself and baby were looking on the day? I did have a lot of anxiety and perhaps it was evident, but I would just like to know whether this is standard practice or not.",

It's proven that children (including baby's) stay much calmer when mom/dad/other comfort person are nearby. As a nurse, I'd suggest letting the baby sit or lay in mom or dads lap, and only restraining when/as much as necessary. Mom or dad can distract the child by talking softly, playing with a toy, reading a book, something like that. Makes the procedure much easier on everyone. Babies can get medical trauma just as easily (if not easier) as older children and adults, and of course it's always best to prevent trauma as much as possible. \n\nSo OP: yes, this can be protocol, but it's outdated and proven not to be the best way to practice. Next time, do what feels good for you and your family. You can absolutely stay with procedures like that, and you have to advocate for you and your baby, because as the mother you often know best.",

      "content": "Sometimes I wonder why I even bother buying nice things for my toddler, because he somehow always finds a way to use them in the most unexpected and financially painful ways. I picked up a pack of really good blueberries recently, the pricey imported kind that influencers pretend to casually snack on, and I thought it would be a nice treat. My son didn’t even eat one. He just pressed them into the wall like he was experimenting with textures and then told me they were yucky. It reminded me of all the other times this happens, like when I buy something I think he’ll enjoy and he ends up ignoring it completely or using it in a way that makes absolutely no sense.\n\nIt is always something. I’ll pick up a nice learning toy like the ones you stick on the magnetic wall decal, and he’ll ignore it and play with the box it came in. I’ll get him new shoes and he’ll refuse to walk and ask to be carried the whole day. I buy a water bottle for him and he still drinks from mine. I buy fruit and he takes one bite and forgets the rest. I set up a comfortable mattress and he sleeps on the floor. I choose a cute outfit for an event and he immediately decides it is the perfect time to poop.\n\n I try not to take it personally, but sometimes it feels like raising a toddler is just accepting that things will never be used the way they were meant to be. I love him to death, of course, but moments like these really make me wonder what other parents have gone through. What’s the most expensive thing you bought that your kid immediately repurposed into something that made you question your life choices?",

There's just always the risk that they become unsupervised (you fall asleep, you step out briefly and can't get in, medical emergency etc.). Plus it gets then used to your safe sleep place and they can associate that with sleep when you start building a routine.

She has her 2mo old vaccines but won’t get her 4mo old set until 5 days after we get back on her 4month “birthday”.\n\nMy husband has a work trip to a place we have always wanted to visit - we love traveling but didn’t get too do much of it due to not having a lot of extra cash laying around so naturally we jumped at the opportunity to go with him since his company will cover his plane ticket, hotel, and some in city travel AND I’m still on maternity leave so no need to take time off from work. \n\nBut my mom mentioned the risk of her getting sick at the airport and her sleep maybe taking a hit which honestly isn’t saying a lot her sleep has been shit from day one and we are cosleeping now following safe sleep guidelines so I feel like our bed or hotel bed won’t make a difference but I would really hate if she were to get sick. We’ve been sick once before, for about a week we all got a cold but she was a champ. Never got a fever just lots of congestion and a tiny cough that lasted a few days. We would be traveling from a big international airport - is it not worth the risk? I am specially worried about HFMD that seems to be going around. \n\nI know people say they won’t remember days from this early but I think she could still have fun and we don’t really see not remembering as a reason to not give her fun experiences now. \n\nDoes anyone have experience traveling with a baby this young specially to a cold place? For reference it’s still about 80degrees where we are and it will be in the mid 40s where we are going!",

I am sooo grateful for that and was really excited about it.\n\nIt has been a hard 2 pas days and my sister arrived yesterday. And maybe i am an asshole but i cannot deal with my family’s excitement of her arrival. She is staying with me and now family wants to come over to visit her. I really don’t want visitors…. I can barely deal with myself and my toddler already. My 15 yo brother also wants to come sleepover so he could enjoy a little fun time with his 2 older sister but i refused.

But i do feel like i am kind of dramatic since everyone seems to be rolling their eyes with my lack of excitement over fun things. Even my husband who is usually super supportive is telling me to chill out a little. I really am trying but also, maybe it is my right to be stressed and wanting peace in this very specific moment?\n\nPlease let me know your honest perspective i don’t know if i am too harsh on myself or if i need to check myself.

Sometimes she fusses for a few minutes and stops, other times she cries and screams the entire time. \n\nThe point being, it’s okay to put your baby in a safe place, close the door, and take a quick shower, start a load of laundry, or just take a breather. \n\nI don’t have it all figured out, but this is helping me at least!

She basically lost her mind. She's overly eager to the point where she says things that make me think she's expecting to be a 3rd parent to my baby... Like she expected I would give birth and give it to her to raise... He was 2 weeks old when she got to babysit because I had to go to the hospital to have my first post C-section check up. She came over with her 2 granddaughters who are 9 and 11. I leave the room for 2 minutes, knowing I left my sleeping baby in his crib and came back to her placing my sleeping child in the lap of the 9 yo who was precariously sat on the edge of the bed because the bed was too high for her. She didn't ask, she just did it because the girl wanted to hold him because he looked like a doll. I had nightmares of my baby being dropped and killed for weeks and I lost all trust in her. \n\nAt the hospital she woke up and kept my 2 days old baby awake for 2 hours because she was excited and wanted to interact with him and kept saying it's gonna be the 2 of them. No it won't!\n\nWe came back from a check-up with our aon and decided to pay her a short visit. I had to breastfeed him and she wouldn't let him eat. She kept petting his cheeks. My husband had to ask her to stop.\n\nThe baby fell asleep and she asked why do we want to wake him to go home. We could just leave him to sleep at her place and leave ourselves. My husband again explained that we're taking our baby home with us. \n\nDuring that visit she mentioned that once my maternity leave is over it's just gonna be the 2 of them, again! I work from home and so does my husband. My son won't be staying with her part time like my BIL did with his kids. I get the clear message that she doesn't get that and she thinks she'll be a semipermanent care giver and he'll be living there for at least part of the week. \n\nAnd recently, my husband mentioned the reason why she's not demanding we leave the baby with her whenever she feels like it, is him. She doesn't feel she can. \n\nSo yeah, I don't feel safe leaving her to babysit because it feels at every turn that she's trying to take my child away from me. I can't even enjoy his baby phase and early years because I'm worried about her trying to take that time away from me under every pretext necessary. She doesn't enjoy spending time with older children so 0-6 or 7 is like the sweet spot for her. It also doesn't help that my BIL left his girls with her weeks at a time. He's divorced now because he's really really not a good husband and the very definition of a momma's boy. \n\nOh, and she hates the names we picked for our son and ahe specifically stated she will never used them. Now she calls him a variation of our last name, if you can believe that. \n\nShe's a consistent source of stress for me.",

But their dad didn’t know how to support me while I navigated my own mental struggles. It’s not his fault I lost my mind. But it was his fault for how he responded to it. \n\nSome time later, after lots of therapy and a 6 month long separation, we decided to give our marriage another chance. It wasn’t easy, the first year after our separation was filled with a lot of hurt and resentment, but slowly, we found our way back to each other. We fell in love all over again. I began to get healthier. My energy was back, my mental health was good. We traveled and took our babies on fun vacations and life seemed to be going right for once. \n\nThe next year I had a routine tonsillectomy go horribly wrong and I nearly died from blood loss. I was in the CCU for 9 days unable to speak, eat, or swallow. My husband really came through for me then. He never left my side. As blood poured from my mouth rushing back to emergency surgery, he held my hand, told me I was beautiful, and that everything would be okay. Recovery was tough. The procedures damaged my heart and due to ulcers from the steroids they gave me to try and clear the swelling in my airway, I developed an upper GI bleed when they nicked an ulcer as they pumped the blood from my stomach. I finally recovered but discovered I had Lupus and POTS during specialists follow-up appointments. And frankly, I felt like shit. I slept more than I was awake and I knew I was doing my daughters a massive injustice as their mother. \n\nAfter a lot of different treatments, I finally found a regime that seemed to work. I was functional, I was able to play with and teach my children. I was present and I genuinely enjoyed their company. My husband and I decided (we’d always said we wanted a big family when we were younger) that our two children were plenty and I likely wouldn’t survive another pregnancy/birth/postpartum. He scheduled his vasectomy appointment for the next month. \n\nThen, as luck would have it, one month before his vasectomy, the condom broke, I took a Plan B, and lo and behold two weeks later I found out I was pregnant with our third girl. \n\nI am now 31. My oldest is almost 9, my second is 6, and my baby is 3 months old. I don’t regret having my baby, I love her so intensely and I couldn’t imagine life without her now. But it has been so hard to go back to square one. I was home free. The big girls were in school, I could’ve gone back to work, I could’ve applied to get my masters degree, I could’ve had 6 hours of the house absolutely silent and to myself 5 days a week. But then I got knocked up. It’s so much harder to have a newborn in your thirties. When I was 22, I could run on 3 hours of sleep and still get shit done. Now I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck just for leaning over to breastfeed. I’ve started all over with chapped nipples, bulky car seats and blowout diapers. And jeez Louise this baby is a high touch stage 5 clinger. The baby takes up so much of my time, attention and energy, I feel I am failing my big girls again. These kids only get one beautiful, precious childhood and I am so afraid I am effing theirs up. \n\nPlease tell me it gets easier. Please tell me the age gap babies are worth it all in the end. Please tell me I’ll stop sweating profusely at night and stop smelling so funky no matter how much I shower. Tell me I’ll sleep again eventually and even though I’m doing it all over again, I’ll be glad I did in the end.",

Due to financial circumstances we decided to move back with the in-laws and to a hotter climate all while our daughter is going through all the challenges of being five months old. She has become very clingy during her day time naps, particularly the lunch time one, which she was starting to get the hang of before the move but now cannot sleep unless it’s a contact nap, which is driving my partner insane, which in turn makes me very anxious. Anyway, my question is, have we fucked up by moving or is just another regression in a long list of regressions and growing pains? \nApologies for ranting or poor writing.",

This time around I wanted glass bottles so we decided to go with evenflo balance+ wide neck since the nipple shape was so similar to lansinoh’s. \n\nMy second born latched right away on the evenflo wides but was so slow at eating from them. She just started daycare last week and it was taking her an hour to finish a 3-4oz bottle. \n\nI got an evenflo standard neck to try because she has a tongue tie (but nurses beautifully) and has started clicking only when eating from the bottle, so I wondered if the wides were just *too* wide for her with her little tongue tie. I had my husband give her a bottle tonight in the standard neck and she downed the whole thing in 10-15 min no problem (we pace feed and use slow nipples, so that’s kind of our target time). \n\nNow I’m wondering what to do with all of my evenflo wide neck bottles and the Philips avent glass that we were also using with the wide nipples. I have so many $$$ worth of glass bottles in my cupboard that we just probably won’t use now, unless we just store them away to maybe use with our next baby?",

Initially, my plan once I returned from maternity leave was to WFH for months 3,4, and 5 alongside baby's grandparents and godparents, and then put baby in daycare at month 6. This was at the suggestion of her godparent, who did this successfully with their other goddaughter. \n\nHowever, last month this plan sort of fell through. I would only have a coworker 2 out of the 5 days, and would be working solo the other three. I checked, and the daycare she's signed up for doesn't have available slots for February or March anyway, and I'm not thrilled about putting her into care and then taking her out for two months before putting her back in again. All in all, I'm leaning towards trying to WFH with her for those three months, but I'm nervous - I really love my job and want to do well at it, and I don't know if it will be possible to be a good employee and a good sole caretaker of an infant at the same time. Does anybody have experience doing this? She's still a newborn right now who sleeps at irregular hours and needs to be attached to me as much as possible, but I know that 3-month olds are a little different. I would love to hear how it went for other parents - is this possible to do in the short term?",

I have much stronger supply with my second baby (knock on wood), and I STILL feel stressed about getting enough every day. And I’m still committed to wanting to EBF anyway. That’s just how I feel. If you feel like that and you’re already making nearly enough and it IS enough if you count your MOTN pump, I would just keep doing what you’re doing except maybe drink more water. \n\nI’d also add that if your body is producing milk at night while the baby sleeps and then the baby drinks that milk during the day, your body is producing what your baby needs! Just at a different time of day. But your baby’s total caloric intake for the day still matches your body’s output for that 24 hours, if that makes sense.\n\nETA: I don’t mean people who combo feed aren’t committed to EBF too.

I felt terrible. \n\nIf daycare is feeding on demand, maybe discuss a feeding schedule? If baby is feeding every 3-4 hours typically, ask that they try to follow that. Your baby is adjusting to the new environment and new people - understandably, baby will be more upset and the new caregivers are still learning how to soothe your baby. Formula is great as a backup for now and maybe in a couple weeks the need to supplement will diminish. For what it’s worth, my baby did 3 bottles per day with 5/4.5/4 oz for several months (up to 7 months maybe?) until we added a meal during daycare. \n\nHope this helps. You are a good mom.",

      "content": "I have seen (and removed) many comments implying that parents who used ByHeart for their children are swept away by marketing, influencers, are bougie, etc. Parents who use formula should not be shamed for using formula, or for which formula they choose to use. \n\nMost parents did extensive research into the formula they chose to feed their baby. Those who chose ByHeart are understandably terrified, sickened, and feeling guilty right now.\n\nThey do not need strangers on the internet piling on telling them their guilt is right, because the brand was \"bougie\" or \"just marketing.\" \n\nPlease check your self-righteousness at the door. This is the time to support parents who are struggling and afraid, not virtue signal. \n\nIf you see comments like these, please report. We will have a low threshold for removing them.\n\nThank you.",

Our first had a complicated birth and needed combo feeding to make weight to leave the hospital and our middle needed combo feeding to help stabilize his blood sugar due to being born pre term.

But after my daughter was born something in my brain just switched. I still loved my dog but I was suddenly super protective over naps and space. Her barking during naps or being glued to me while I was trying to settle the baby would stress me out in a way it never used to. She also started peeing on the floor of my baby’s spaces. Only the places where the baby spent time. \n\nShe had been so good with the baby until 2 days ago.  My baby crawled up to her while she was asleep and she snapped from being startled. It wasn’t aggression, just fear, but I knew as soon as it happened I would never be able to leave them alone together again. \n\nI ended up finding her a really sweet couple with a quiet home and no kids. They already seemed to adore her and I know she’ll be more relaxed there than in the chaos here. But coming home without her hit me super hard. Her bowl is still sitting in the kitchen. Nobody ran to the door. I keep almost calling her name out of habit.\n\nAnd before the “just separate them” comments — she was a total Velcro dog. She needed to be touching me at all times. If I gated off the playroom so the baby could crawl she’d sit on the other side and cry nonstop. It wasn’t workable at all for her or for me.\n\nI just feel sad and guilty and honestly kind of lost.\nIf anyone else has gone through this after having a baby… how did you cope?\nDid the guilt get better?\nDid your dog adjust okay?",

I see so many of these on this sub (and people asking if they’d be terrible to rehome) but they haven’t even tried to get the dog trained and just expect the dog to adapt. It can take years for animals to adapt to new environments. But if people would treat their dogs as something that also needs to be prepared for the arrival of a new addition I think a lot of these situations could be avoided. So many people just expect dogs to adjust immediately and that’s not how it happens for a lot of dogs. I’m not saying if the dog gets aggressive just ignore (clearly that’s different) but a dog being whiney or clingy can definitely be trained. It just takes time and planning. We also have a Velcro dog and we’re able to get him trained properly so we could separate baby and dog until they were ready to interact properly. We still can’t leave the room without dog panicking but his anxiety was much reduced once he was trained. \n\nLetting your baby crawl on a sleeping dog is a huge no no.",

I was right there when it happened. We were all on the bed, my baby crawled toward me, the dog was asleep by my leg, and she snapped awake in half a second. That’s not poor supervision. That’s the result of a stressed out dog reaching her breaking point. \n\nAnd if it had ONLY been that moment, this wouldn’t even be a discussion. But it wasn’t. My house smelled like pee even when I cleaned constantly, she barked at every noise, chewed things up, paced nonstop. She just couldn’t settle. I’d tried plenty of different things to improve the situation over the months, and nothing changed. She was getting more anxious as the baby got more mobile.\n\nAnd the ‘teach the baby boundaries’ thing… she’s six months old. There are no boundaries. And I’m not locking them in separate corners of the house every time I grab a bottle. That’s not realistic.\n\nPeople keep tossing out training and meds like they’re magic fixes. They’re not. Training can’t fix a dog who’s stressed 24/7, and meds aren’t guaranteed to do much besides take the edge off. At some point I had to accept she wasn’t thriving here anymore, and that was hard.\n\nShe didn’t go to a shelter. She went to a quiet, adult-only home with people who genuinely wanted her. She settled fast. She wasn’t happy here anymore, and they can give her the calm routine she needs.\n\nI did what protected my baby and kept my dog from being labeled dangerous . It wasn’t an easy decision at all, but I can’t risk my child’s safety. I loved my dog so much, but my baby comes first. every single time.",

Every situation, dog, baby and parent are different, so no one can blame you for doing the safest thing for your family AND dog. If something terrible happened, first of all it would be unfair to your dog to pay the consequences and also to all your family, because you'd have to live with it afterwards.\n\nWere there other ways to manage the situation? Yes. But not everyone is up to sacrificing mental energy, time and effort to train your dog and keep separating them. Especially when you have a new baby you just want to enjoy. \n\nI'm speaking as an owner of a velcro dog. It can be very hard, they need a lot of training and time to get accustomed to new home situations and you obviously have less patience to go through this when you have a baby.\n\nPlus, if you found a truly loving family for your dog and you know they'll live a stress free life with them, I completely understand you. \n\nThe most efficient way you could have handled this is to actually allow your dog to get used to being separated from you, with training, but before birth obviously. Again it takes much effort and is time consuming, but it's the most fair thing you can do so that your dog can make the right choices when the baby comes. It's really unfair to expect a dog to behave differently all of a sudden, when that's what it knew from day one you had them. And it's really unfair for the dog to have to live with the stress of a baby at home, without guidance.\n\nAgain, you don't have to do all these things. They are different options and not everything works for everyone. Don't let anyone fill you with guilt, and know that maybe these harder options were not for you at this moment. They were there, but you chose something else for your own reasons. No shame in that, since your dog is also enjoying its new home and family. \n\nTake care and good luck with everything🥰",

You said it yourself, your dog was asleep and it was out of fear. Not that that makes it okay AT ALL, but to me it does make a difference. I think having a baby in the home is a time to learn new ways for EVERYONE. Including your dog. Had this happened to me, I would have scolded the dog and immediately began training and desensitizing. It’s also important to teach your child(ren) how to be around dogs. I know your child is still an infant it sounds like, but now there isn’t much opportunity to teach them about space, or respecting the animal as well as they grow. Any dog or animal you bring into their life, you will have to also teach your child how to be around them no matter what. I think all these things have a time and place. No but really, I think it’s normal for dogs to need an adjustment period and sometimes they need guidance from us, like training. If your dog has never been around a baby prior to yours….its not really their fault. I know you mentioned never being able to leave them along together after this, but to be honest, a child should never be left alone with ANY dog ever. No matter how amazing the dog has been, no matter the relationship. It’s never 100% fully safe to leave your child alone with a dog. I have two dogs and two children (toddler and infant) and they all get along so well. But I’d never leave them along together. Because at the end of the day, as much as I love them, they are still dogs. \n\nAgain I’m not saying you did the wrong thing, I think it just comes down to if you want to try and make things work between your dog and your child. If it feels more work than you care to give during this time (totally understandable) then I think you made the right choice. If you’re absolutely devastated and want your dog in your life until their time is up, then I’d start doing any and all research on training, desensitizing, teaching your child about animals and start all of it immediately, continuing as they grow. Doesn’t mean it’ll all work right away, or even at all, but if it’s worth it to you to try then try!",

It sounds like the snapping was the tipping point. \n\nToo often these cues go ignored on the assumption that it was a one-off or the dog can be trained out of it, and when it doesn’t work owners are blamed for allowing their babies to be harmed (or killed) and for their dogs to be euthanised. \n\nPlease don’t make OP feel bad for not being one of those parents.",

I had him since I was 5 and put him down at 20. I was heart broken over the fact that if I happened to decide to have children soon he wouldn’t be here to guide them through their first few years of life. Here I am turning 22 in a few months with a 1 month old and you made me realize that your kind of heartbreak may be worst. Thinking about my protective instincts and sanitary areas for baby. I would’ve had to rehome my pup regardless if I wanted to or not. He was a Velcro boy and didn’t understand the concept of space, along with going to the bathroom outdoors he would be peeing in all the areas baby spends his time. Had bad hips and it would be a safety risk as he would trip quite frequently. For once since losing him I feel some sort of relief and closure. my dog may not have been able to be here to meet my baby. But he was here long enough to get me through everything and send me into the next chapter of life, along with completing his time here on earth. As if to it was meant to happen like this. I don’t know what I would’ve done if I had to made the decision to part ways with him and trust another human to love him the way I did. I hope it’s not selfish to thank you for giving me a different view on my loss and understanding it was meant to happen that way. \n\nThe strength that it took for you to do this is seen. You’re strong for that. I understand the pain of coming home to silence instead of hearing a tail smack the wall out of excitement. You did what you needed to do for the safety of your baby and you made the best decision. I’m sorry you’re experiencing this but it might also open up an opportunity for you to give your baby the same experience you got with your pup, but with their own. Maybe a few years down the road you’ll meet a doggo to bring home that is compatible with your family. I hope you find peace in the situation and please take care of your mental health. Losing a dog regardless of what way it happens, it takes a lot out of someone.",

I got her from a flea market and she had always had many issues with separation anxiety, barking (due to the separation anxiety) any time someone would touch their keys or she thought they were leaving the house. She would quite literally bark for 20 minutes straight if she knew I was getting ready to leave for work. She was my Velcro dog and I loved her, but she hadn’t been right for years. She also had a bite history. She had bitten me and others numerous times. About 6 years ago when I was dating my husband, she was laying on my lap, when I made her move so I could get up to go to the bathroom and she bit my arm so badly I had a hematoma and had to get a tetanus shot. On this occasion, she wouldn’t let go of my arm and I don’t even remember how I got her off of my arm, but it was almost like she was in a trance and I couldn’t trust her after that. My husband took a larger role with her as he didn’t want to get rid of her- she would likely get put down vs. rehomed with a bite history like that. \n\nFast forward to having my son, I did not want her around him at all for obvious reasons. She had a lot of behavioral problems occurring that just got worse over the past year. It got to the point where she was having accidents on our things, peeing in places for no reason, and getting up all night (as well as the baby) to where it just became unmanageable. After she bit my husband, I decided to have her put down. The most difficult choice of my life, but one I had to do. I knew I couldn’t rehome her with her bite history.\n\nBasically, I just want to tell you that if you felt that you had to do this, you did the right thing. Even if you didn’t really want to do it. You prevented something tragic from happening and gave the dog a good life with a new family. I am so sorry. I can relate to what you’re going through 🩷",

I had to get vaccination and hospital trips against infections. It made me realize that it could be my baby who would have gotten bitten if I don’t take action so me and my husband send him for training ( which was extremely expensive and out of budget but we did not just wanna give up on him). Mind you after I was bitten I had the same switch go on about protecting my baby. When we came back home from the training center we dropped him off to we both cried with my husband and felt very guilty. But even with two months of training his aggression never ended so we decided to re-home him. He is doing well and is very happy, at the end of the day you did what was best for you, your baby and your dog.

We immediately separated them at all times, got a trainer, started her on anxiety meds. We did all the things. But she was miserable. She was glued to us and didn’t want to live a life separated from us. We decided no amount of training we did would make us feel comfortable coexisting together because we knew she had exhibited that behavior towards him several times and we would never feel safe with them being near each other. And living a life separated from us for the rest of her life wasn’t fair to her. So we found a new home, it unfortunately didn’t work out. So we brought her back home. We spent months trying to rehome again, trying even more expensive anxiety medication. Because of her age and various other challenges (aggressive towards other dogs, terrible on a leash) it made her very difficult to rehome. After consulting with vets and dog rescues, they all gave us the recommendation of behavioral euthanasia. So we did that in September 3 weeks before our second baby was born. \n\nIt was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I still cry about it. But it was the right move to keep our babies safe. We couldn’t live the way we were living anymore. Every day felt like a gamble of risking our child’s safety and it’s not worth it. Nothing is worth it your child’s safety. You did the best thing for you child even though it is absolutely gut wrenching. She was my soul dog too but things changed after my toddler was born. She was annoying and similar things aggravated me. But once she showed aggression towards him, I viewed her as a threat and it really altered our relationship unfortunately. You did the right thing and you are protecting your baby. You did what you had to do. It does get easier, I promise.  I’m so sorry you’re in this situation, it truly is horrible.",

Hope you’re all well.\n\nI had a look at several screen time related threads in the Science Based Parenting subreddit, and the general consensus there seems to be: all screen time bad, even if the shows are not targeted at children, and even if it’s just background noise.\n\nI have a couple questions about this, and maybe you could share some of your experiences and approach.\n\n1. How are you with TVs at home realistically? We’re a very show-heavy couple, and as much as I can definitely not give my child access to smartphones or tablets for a very long time, removing TV completely from our lives feels drastic and like an unsustainable long term change. Did any of you struggle with this? Did you cut out ALL TV? Or just limited it?\n\n2. If TV as background noise is bad, because it impacts child’s focus and language development, how does it differ from music, podcasts, or radio? If the child doesn’t see the video aspect at all? \n\n3. Isn’t cutting out ALL TV also bad? Shouldn’t it be normalised in the house - as a part of life, but not essential to being happy, or eating, relaxing, falling asleep. I’m thinking in similar terms to when you don’t let your child have sugar or sweet treats at all, and then once they get access to them they might go crazy.\n\n4. Could having TV on in the background at times be balanced by speaking to the child a lot, lots of reading together, doing activities and chores together?\n\nAny realistic advice and anecdotes would be appreciated!\n\nAlso for context, I’m dealing with a 4 month old right now!\n\nETA: thank you all for commenting! I feel like lots of valid points of view are being discussed here, both for and against screens. \n\nFor some more context for how it is in our house atm: I turn off TV for most if not all wake windows, especially if we’re reading or playing. Sometimes, after a long day, the TV stays on as a distraction for me (I still find it challenging to care for baby full time and have that and chores as my sole focus) and never on a kids show. We go on long walks daily, I talk at her incessantly (and have conversations in the googoo gaga language), we look at books together (I used to read to her more long form but she started getting irritated by no visual stimulation, so I haven’t done that in a few weeks; hopefully that phase passes), play with rattles, touch textures, etc. I sing to her a lot too. Her dad does the same when it’s his turn to play, or we do it together. I also do chores either with her on me (babywearing) or her watching me, and I tend to narrate what I’m doing. I’m hoping a high amount of interaction like this will compensate for any damage passive TV presence might do.",

The kinds of people who institute zero screentime are also the people who have the time, energy and physical ability to provide lots of alternative activities.

The alternative to tv time was me losing my mind. In that scenario, there is no way that screentime is more detrimental than no screentime. \n\nHes now 5 and we don’t have screentime during the week as we found it affected behaviour (mainly just caused arguments when it was time to get dressed for school or into PJs or whatever). But he gets access pretty freely at the weekend, and he often turns it off to play music or play or to do other activities. To me, that’s a balanced attitude towards it.",

We got onto a pretty good schedule (not good sleep mind you lol) around 6 months old so she went to be pretty consistently around 8pm so we had some time to watch a show or two. \n\n2) I would put an ear bud in if I wanted to listen to a podcast but I often have instrumental music playing in the background at home. Babies don’t learn from recorded voices (from everything I’ve read) so a podcast and radio work like tv in that they provide no language benefit for babies and can distract caregivers from providing social interaction. I don’t think it’s as bad as tv because it’s not overstimulating with colors and cutting scenes. \n\n3) I think normalizing tv is best done when kids are a bit older, personally. Babies genuinely get overstimulated by how quickly screens move and their brains are developing so much during infancy, I just would be cautious with screens during the first year. My baby is now 18 months and we can have the tv on and she will watch for a minute or two but doesn’t care much (we don’t do this often but once a week or so, we might have the tv on for a bit). \n\n4) You know the science so it’s up to you to decide what you want to do for your family. I think it’s always best to err on the side of less tv but tv isn’t going to rot your baby’s brain and if you watch a show now and then, your baby will be fine.\n\n\nI think it’s all about balance. I avoided screen time for my baby 99% of the time and I’m happy with my choice. But there are many families that don’t limit them as strictly and their kids are perfectly fine.

TV noise and images can also prevent young children from concentrating fully during play, which is detrimental. \n\n\nWe are 100 per cent no phone or tablet for our child, even past the two years recommended. But we watch TV with him in the room. I do it while he napS in the afternoon, he watches football with dad on Sunday, and he is occasionally awake when we are both trying to watch something together. When he was a newborn the TV was almost always on haha, but that is just survival of cluster feeding and sleepless nights. \n\n\nI grew up on TV so I am not convinced that sharing TV time as a family is negative. However, I don't leave it on as background noise all day because I do think it's distracting for baby's independent play now that he is 3.5 months. \n\n\nAs for podcasts, I feel they - like TV - re fine in moderation as long as you are spending good one on one time with baby throughout the day. \n\n\nIf you are playing, talking with and reading stories to baby throughout the day, a podcast for a bit or some TV isn't going to do any damage (in my humble opinion).",

It wasn’t as huge an adjustment as I thought it’d be. And I’m a screen on for background noise all the time kind of person.\n\n2. Part of the problem is not the baby’s focus, but rather yours. Parents talk less when screens are on . If it’s an adult show you aren’t going to look at your baby for a connection based on what you saw and laugh. You might miss a moment when your baby is looking to you for a connection or validation. Those moments slowly add up. With music, you might sing to your baby or dance with them. Podcasts bore me to death so I can’t compare it to that and am not sure on the research.\n\n3. I don’t subscribe to the mentality of this at all. I had full access to TV and sugar as a kid and am pretty addicted to both. Neither were propped up or banned. My anecdotal experience as a teacher and nanny tells me kids learn how to be creative and make fun when they are not stimulated or expected to be stimulated all the time. Every ounce of fine motor development helps. And every minute they stare at a screen reduces that development. That’s just my opinion and take on it. \n\n4. Not sure about this one.

She gets tv time on the weekends now. She is in daycare during the week so I want to give her my full attention as much as I can when she is home. But on weekends it’s a nice way for us to bond, and it also allows me to clean the house and stuff. \n\nMy understanding with TV is that it is the flashing lights and bright colours that affect kids and most just babies, not the sound. And that the pictures do not ‘return’ when the child tries to interact with them (serve and return. Like baby coos and you coo back). I think kids are advanced enough to understand that just because a picture is moving it is real, and it is still a picture. But little babies that’s harder. We also watch older cartoons, that have muted colours, the camera angles don’t change as much, and the screen doesn’t flash. \n\nI think normalizing it depends on the household.

That decreased attention overtime delays social and language development (theoretically). I personally just have it off all the time unless baby is asleep. But im an all or nothing tv watcher. If my show is on I want to pay attention to it. There is tons of time for tv during naps and after bedtime. My husband and I have finished all of stranger things, half of smallville and a ton of Halloween movies all after bedtime. \n\nFurthermore, there is something to be said about the negitve effect of background stimulation. You baby is probably glancing at the screen often. If not, they are definitely hearing all the music and dialogue in a show which is muddling you and people around them speaking. At best they ignore it and you half-watch something. Worse, theyre overstimulated. Even worse, they get used to constant stimulation and wont tolerate things like sit still and engaging with you at a restaurant when theyre older. \n\nI sit on the ground with toys and show my baby “car, beep beep. (move car) car vroom (move faster) car go go go fast! (bump car into him) crassssshh” meet his eyes, encourage him to play, act animated, be involved. this is valuable language development that you cant get with tv on in the background. Not to be holier than thou but thats just my 2c as someone whos strict on screentime\n\nEdit: also I hate this common take that turning screens off during wake windows is “unrealistic”. Really? How? Its not unrealistic to go 3-5 hr increments without tv guys, cmon. And if you truly think it is perhaps you should do it for your own health and to see how beneficial a screen detox can truly be. Looking at the trees blow around outside your window is a healthy thing that is not often practiced anymore in this horribly overstimulating age of fast media.",

AITA for getting my baby out of her car seat at a bar and grill as she thereafter proceeded to vocalize while she had been content in her seat. \n\nToday my husband asked me if I wanted to go out to eat, sure. Us plus our 7mo hopped in the car and headed out. We have a car seat/ stroller combo. Soon before we arrived she had fallen asleep in the car, but woke up between the jostling out of the car since he parked next to the shrub divider and the wind. He picked a bar with a dining area. We sat at a table in the corner and a table of 7 adults + 3 (10-15 aged) kids were also sitting down at the same time near by. There were a few other small groups in the dining area (40x40 enclosed patio) and another 8-10 people in the bar. Moderately busy for this place. There are TVs in the bar area, but no tv audio, just a music station is playing. \n\nWhile waiting to order, I clean the table with a disinfectant wipe. Then after our order is taken, I grab out baby out of the car seat to sit on my lap. She had been quietly observing. Soon after she starts “singing”. Basically she loudly vocalizes as she’s joining in all the chatter of the room. She never got fussy in her noises. My husband begins shushing her and I can tell he’s getting agitated. I reminded him she’s a baby and she is ultimately not bothering anyone while she has made her presence known. He tells me that she’s being loud because I got her out of her seat and I should have just left her in there. He tells me to get a bottle ready though she ate before we left. \n\nI put her back in because I’m annoyed now too at his reaction and shushing. She continues while back in her seat and I work to distract her with toys and a paci (she’s not a regular paci user). While we’re eating she’s a bit quieter, but when we’re done she picks up again. I take her out to the car and leave him to pay the bill. \n\nWhile I was standing in the car door near the bar entrance and I was entertaining baby waiting for my husband. One of the men from the large table came out to smoke and I only realized he was there as he said, How I miss those sounds. His shirt had a saying about being a dad. We chatted until he was done and he headed back in. \n\nWe were also out a few weeks ago at a family steak restaurant and I had gotten her out and gave her some food from home to try. \n\nWhat is the baby out to eat etiquette? Should we leave her in her seat? After this experience I’m ready to just stick to take. Any other suggestions?",

Ask your doctor refferal to see gastroenterolog or allergist.\n\n\nAlso try to stick with as simple routine as possible, because if you use so many products you might not even know what helps and what makes it works. So water, gentle soap, pat dry very good after every pee and poo, put healing ointment like bepanthenol baby or similar. And air baths do miracles. If you really need wet wipes when you are out, use one brand, look for the least amount of ingredients (like water wipes), but, of course, try to avoid wipes as much as possible and dont forget to pat dry with a muslin after using wipes!",

We tried almost everything that you had as well. It’s so frustrating and heartbreaking. Thankfully our baby wasn’t super uncomfortable. We were more bothered by it than he was. Similarly, my little guy was pooping SO MUCH. I think one day we counted and he went 15 times…thankfully that gets better as they get older and they go less and less as they grow. \n\nWe exclusively use dry wipes now. If the poop is particularly bad, we will wet the dry wipe with a little bit of water and then follow with a dry wipe. Our favorite is the Whoopie brand from Amazon (has a lion on the front). They can be used for much more than diaper changes. Honest also has some but they are smaller and more expensive. We try to make sure he is as dry as possible before putting his diaper on or applying any cream. We’ll use a hand held fan or stroller fan if we have time and he’s not particularly squirmy. Some people use a hair dryer on cool setting. \n\nOur pediatrician prescribed a compound cream that helped ease and protect the booty from the acidity of his poops. This helped especially during the times that he was popping around the clock. It was cholestyramine compounded with aquaphor. Unfortunately with diaper rashes, especially ones that won’t go away, it’s more than one thing. Look for “kissing” lesions aka does the rash mirror itself on each side of the cheeks. If so, it may be bacterial and you might need a topical antibiotic. \n\nMy heart is with you. Know that it WILL get better.",

She's been sleeping through the night for months now.  Lately, however, she's been waking up absolutely soaked. She's peed so much her diaper has overflowed and her clothes are wet.  At first I thought maybe her daddy forgot to change her right before bed (I work evenings, so he does bedtime) because he's been working a lot of overtime, getting over a cold, and he's exhausted, so I thought it was just that. However, the nights I'm home I do bedtime and I put a fresh, dry diaper on her just before bed and she's still waking up soaked.  Her diapers aren't too small, she's still got plenty of room in there.\n\nAnyone else have this issue? Any tips?  I'd hate to wake her up in the middle of the night to change her, but I also don't want her waking up drenched in pee each morning 😅",

During pregnancy I was pretty well decided to bottlefeed after discussing with my husband and therapist as I get overstimulated easily and it can be very dissociating ( following past trauma of Sexual abuse during childhood).  My husband was very supportive, but when my baby came, I started to breastfeed in the hospital to give her the colostrum, and this special bond with her was created.  Every time I breastfed it felt very special and I did not feel alienated like I was expecting to. However, baby had a poor latch, I have flat nipples, was given the wrong flange sizes, ended up with bleeding nipples.  I kept trying to increase my supply by breastfeeding with the right techniques and pumping( with the correct flange sizes) and even took domperon to increase my supply, but baby did not like to latch to the nipple and got tired of the nipple shield as well.  My supply is almost down to less than an oz per day and I am exclusively bottlefeeding.  It feels like a sense of loss and grief when having to stop breastfeeding; like losing a bond.  Less guilt, as I managed to give her the colostrum at least; nevertheless I never expected that I would experience this kind of grief..",

      "content": "First time mom here and I’m looking for advice on how you all manage to get some chores done around the house or even get out of the house with the baby for some social event. I feel like I’m stuck in the house and not being able to get anything done at all since the day my baby was born, and I’m slowing losing my mind. \n\nI feel like I have a difficult baby who’s prone to crying. He cries every time when he’s waking up from sleep; cries when getting diaper changed; cries when being held in most positions; basically the only time he’s not crying is when he’s sleeping or the first 10-15 mins of wake window until he’s bored of whatever activity he’s doing. He also fights REALLY hard to nap - It usually takes more than 30+ mins to put him to nap during the day and he’d cry/scream the entire time. I follow all the tips: 5s’, keep the room dark, comfortable temperature, white noise, etc but it’s still a battle. He also doesn’t nap in his bassinet, only on me. \n\nSo with all the crying and the time it takes to soothe him, plus feeding every 2-3 hours, I’m basically trapped with him in the house (mostly in a dark room) with no downtime to do anything. It’s almost impossible to find a couple mins to go to the bathroom. I want to take him out sometimes but I’m so intimidated by it, thinking he’s going to scream in public and I won’t be able to get him under control. \n\nWhat can I do to make my life a little less miserable? I’ve seen people use a carrier and wear their babies around the house. How does that even work? Do you put the baby in when they’re awake and let them fall asleep in the carrier then just go by your day? Am I being too overly cautious about disturbing his nap time and the environment? Should I just let him get used to the noise and light during the day and try to let him nap somewhere else other than his protected nursery? \n\nAny advice would be appreciated! I’m so exhausted from his fussiness and tiptoeing around him all the time. I just want a little bit of normalcy.",

You don't want to be tiptoeing around baby napping forever, so the earlier you can get them used to noise while they're sleeping the better. \n\nI usually put baby in the carrier awake and do things around the house while they're still awake. If they fall asleep, fine! I usually have some instrumental music on and I narrate what I'm doing so baby can see and hear new things. At that age we would also go out on walks or errands with baby in the carrier and she'd just fall asleep if she got tired (the grocery store was a good one in particular).

My little girl is 12 weeks now, and day time naps are around 20-30 mins unless she's sleeping on me in one way or another.\n\nI have noticed that making a clear distinction between day time and night time helps. Especially going outside!\n\nI'm not gonna lie, there is a real chance your LO will cry in public. It happens. My baby does NOT like it when I put her in the stroller, but by the time we're walking, she calms right down (and usually falls asleep within 5 mins).\n\nBaby wearing sometimes works! My LO is stubborn AF though (she gets it from her mama), and will let me know when she's not having it. \nIf I need to put up laundry or run a quick errand, I put her in when she's awake (usually after a diaper change), take a few mins to shush and sway her until she calms down, and go about my business.\n\nLastly, some words of encouragement: the more your baby wakes up to the world, the easier it gets. If I look back at messages I sent a few weeks ago, I hardly got anything done.\n\nNow, she can spend up to half an hour on her play mat under a mirror and entertain herself while I quickly do some dishes or make (and eat!) some food.\n\nYou got this. Being a mother is the hardest things I've ever done, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.\n\nBig hug, and good luck!",

      "content": "I love my baby and my partner more than anything. \n\nMy son is 3.5 months old. He's the coolest thing ever. He woke up three weeks ago with a personality and now he's so, so funny. He is physically advanced but obviously still cognitively simple. When he learned to roll at 12 weeks, he would shock himself by being on his stomach and kick like crazy. Now he is figuring out army crawling and absolutely losing his mind when he pushes himself face first into his stuffed animals- he doesn't know he needs to move to breathe so he just gasps loud and scrunches his face until I move them. He's great. \n\nI used to be the most ambitious person I knew. I've travelled a bunch, am super artsy, I am very social. I used to love who I was. My partner is similarly driven. Since our son was born, I am the one raising him. I am privileged enough to get to stay home while he's so little- I wouldn't want anyone but us caring for him this young anyway. He wakes every 45 minutes at night, hates his crib, so I get 3 hours of sleep on a good day. I have no family or friends near. My partner isn't really interested in raising the baby. He loves him and thinks he's cute and laughs with him and has loads of pictures of him, but my only breaks are to cook, sometimes clean, shower every four days. He doesn't read to him or really engage him. The baby spends his time with his dad sitting on his lap while he plays videos games or scrolls, or laying on his kick mat while his dad scrolls next to him, or being bounced and shushed even if he's not tired so his dad can do other things. As such, I cook quickly so I can go back to holding him. Our division of child care is, if I'm being generous 85-15, likely closer to 90-10. \n\nI need to learn to let go of my hobbies and interests. I feel like I'm being tortured by knowing my laptop is 5 feet away and I could write a story or something if only someone could watch my baby. I don't even want to talk to my friends because I get overwhelmed with jealousy when they describe a movie they enjoyed or a place they went. I used to love running; I don't imagine going to the gym will be a possibility in the future. I care about my appearance, and haven't been able to do my hair, which is currently falling out, in weeks. I do not want my partner to have to give up his life because of me, but he is out with friends tonight and I have been crying and crying and crying with envy.\n\nHow do I let go? How do I accept that this is my life now?",

My daughter is now 19mo and flat out refuses for him to do most things. So even if he wanted to do diaper changes, get her dressed, etc, my daughter will kick and scream, making it that much harder to get back to a 50/50 state. You gotta nip it in the bud. The earlier he does childcare the easier it is to do more. Can I suggest starting with a set time (eg Saturday 6-10am) where he is the “default parent” - ie solely responsible for all your sons needs.

I have really tried talking to him about the importance of not being on his phone when he’s with her, as a condition of him being with her at all, and he’s more or less gotten the gist of that. I think this is the most important thing. \n\nAs far as your hobbies go, can you do anything while baby naps? My baby exclusively contact naps and while she’s in my arms I’m able to get loads done on my phone - making videos, working on her baby book, messaging friends, therapy(!), reading an incredible amount of books, watching tv or movies. Taking this nap time to really devote to my own interests helps me a lot! \n\nI also baby wear all the time since baby always wants to be held. Baby is in the ring sling quite often, and I get all my housework and cooking done with her there. Baby sits in an activity center that I put in the bathroom while I take a quick shower. \n\nI take baby on stroller walks or hikes in the carrier every day and this truly preserves my sanity. If you’re a runner, can you run outside with a jogging stroller? You get your exercise, baby gets an outing, it’s a win win. \n\nEverything is harder when you are sleep deprived. I’d strongly suggest you look into safe sleep 7 cosleeping. It has saved me. It’s soooo much easier because for every wake I don’t have to get out of bed, I stay half asleep and baby goes right back to sleep with a little nurse. I honestly feel so bad for anyone who is experiencing sleep deprivation from having a baby because it really doesn’t need to be like that. Humans have been sleeping with their babies since the beginning of our existence, it’s frickin weird how much hate cosleeping gets now. \n\nObviously the issues with your husband need to be worked out - like if he’s truly only with the baby for like an hour a day then he should be present with the baby during that time. Not playing video games or on his phone. But everything else? I feel like it’s just about figuring out how to make it work for you that allows you to still live your life: and in my mind, that’s baby wearing, cosleeping, contact napping and doing hobbies then (write your story girl!), outdoor hikes/walks/runs. Hope things improve for you!",

I did the SAHM thing when my oldest was born and let me tell you… I could not WAIT to go back to work after that first year. You need to sit down and have a conversation about the division of labor at home. This is a full tiem job but you need breaks. Even he gets a lunch break and to clock out at the end of the day.

If there’s any ways for you to split nights I swear that changed my life. It wasn’t possible until I switched to formula though so if you’re breastfeeding, maybe have him set out your water and some snacks before you go to “bed” so he’s helping at least somewhat overnight. That 3-4 month age was the hardest for us sleep wise but I promise it does get better and eventually you slowly start feeling like yourself again. Eventually they start napping alone and it gets longer so you can try to do things for yourself during that time.",

You can get back to pursuits like that in a few years. Unfortunately there is a big choice in living for you versus living for kids. Having just one is the best hope you have of keeping the life you seem to miss, but even then there's compromise.\n\nFirst few months the kid is more dependent on mom anyways, and if youre stay at home and your husband isn't, it may not be fair to have 90/10 split of domestic duties, but 60/40-75/25 is probably pretty reasonable. Ask him to step up a bit, but at this stage you may have to get creative to maintain your identity and appearance if thats something you still want, even if your husband agreed to 50/50. Just know that men get burned out too, and if you expected 50/50 on domestic duties, he's going to lose his mind too if hes also the only one working a job.",

      "content": "My son is deep in the dreaded 4 month sleep regression. Even as a newborn he regularly gave us an initial 3–4 hour stretch, and between 8 weeks and 16 weeks he was giving us an initial 6 hour stretch very consistently, occasionally flirting with 7-8 hours of solid sleep. But for the past 2–3 weeks his sleep, both day and night, has gone to total hell. Last night was his worst night ever, waking up every hour, with 90 minutes being his longest stretch.\n\nI am personally very against any form of CIO or cosleeping at this age, but I do want to tighten up his routines to see if that helps. The problem is that I have no idea how to actually do that.\n\nFor example, let us say his nap routine is to pull the shades down, put on some lullabies, and give him a bottle. Great, he drinks the whole bottle and is still awake…now what? Or, at nighttime, we have been trying to play him the same song every evening to signal bedtime. What if he falls asleep 15 minutes before it’s time to play the song? Do we play it while he’s asleep? Wake him up so he hears it and then put him back down? None of that is intuitive to me.\n\nHe also hates baths and lotion, and he wears sleep ‘n play pjs day and night, so a lot of the usual routine suggestions don’t seem like a good fit for him.\n\nI would love to hear from anyone who had a similar situation and figured out how to create a routine that actually works when your baby fights sleep and none of the “usual” steps fit.",

We didn’t use CIO (I prefer gentler methods) and within 2 weeks she was sleeping 10-11 hr stretches with no wake ups.\n\nOne of the big things that helped us: A HARD wake up time and bedtime. We wake her up every day by 7:30am. She usually wakes by herself around 7:20-7:25am, but if she doesn’t then I wake her up. We make sure to have appropriate wake windows throughout the day, and then at night we start bedtime at 7:30pm. Bottle, PJs, book, song, white noise, bed. (Even if baby wears PJs during the day, just change into different ones.) Since we sleep trained we put her in bed awake, but without sleep training you may not have luck with that. \n\nAs for if baby falls asleep before the song… either don’t play it or keep him awake until you play it. Playing it while he sleeps sounds silly to me lol.",

But once I stopped, my mental health improved drastically. So please give yourself some grace and pull the plug if that is what you want to do, spend more time with your beautiful baby. I just had my second baby a couple weeks ago and the decision was much easier this time, I could not keep up breastfeeding with his voracious appetite so I switched to formula.",

However, she’s been napping independently in her bassinet during the day since she was around 4-5 weeks and she puts herself back to sleep when she wakes up most of the time. She wears an owlet during independent naps and at night so i can see the periods of time she wakes up. She’ll be awake for 10-20 minutes and then just… go back to sleep? No paci in her mouth, no crying or fussing. I was starting to worry that i wasn’t waking up to her cries but last night i woke up and looked over into her bassinet and she was wide awake just hanging out. A few minutes later she was asleep again. She also hasn’t woken us up to eat, be changed, or even be soothed at night since she was around 4 weeks old. She just sleeps through. Sometimes she’ll fuss in the morning if it gets past 8am and we’re not up yet but other than that, nothing.

We started solids right at 6 months because from 5 months on he was obsessed with watching us (and the dog lol) eat. I thought he would LOVE eating. First couple attempts with oat cereal he did seem to love it. But since then he’s been pretty lukewarm no matter what we give him. We’ve tried avocado, banana, sweet potato, pea, egg, plus almond and peanut. All purees that we made ourselves. And he mostly tolerates being fed, but hasn’t really taken to it. He’ll do a few bites but then it’s clear he doesn’t want anymore, and we never force him to keep eating.\n\nWe’re nowhere close to having solids replace even a single meal during the day. The other challenge is that my husband and I have both gone back to work full time since we first started solids, and because of our busy schedules and the fact that he never seems to love eating food we’re getting really bad about being consistent with it. Realistically, he’s only getting solids 1-2 days a week now, which I’m sure isn’t helping him get more used to it. I’m feeling so guilty like we’re failing him at this.\n\nI’ve heard the saying “food before one is just for fun” and I know babies can change so quickly - a month from now something might click and he’ll be eating a full meal everyday. Are we really behind here? How do working parents incorporate solids into their everyday routine?",

The general gist is that every baby is different and your baby will most likely eventually begin eating solid food like every other person. Don’t worry about it. The only thing you should do is be more consistent about it. Try to do it every day or every other day. Make the time for it even if it means you sacrifice a nap or a shower tho",

The idea of ‘just for fun’ isn’t based in fact. \n\nFeeding your child solids doesn’t have to be difficult. What are you eating every day? Baby can eat with you. I never bothered with purées even though my daughter had no teeth until she was 9 months old, they’re surprisingly effective with their gums! I like flavourful food, so I’m unsurprised that she responded well to eating what we ate. My logic was that I wouldn’t want to eat mush, so I just offered her an age-appropriate serving of our meals. \n\nI believe there’s some correlation around introducing different food textures to children early so they don’t become picky eaters too.",

It only lasts for about 5 seconds and then he stops. Twice now it’s happened in the middle of the night, and it happened once during a daytime nap when I was sitting next to him on the couch. \n\nFrom what I understand, it’s normal and just a thing that babies do. But it’s fucking SCARY. My husband and I shot out of bed this morning when it happened because it’s like a shock to your system when you hear your baby wailing when it’s dead silent in your room. I run over to him and he’s just wiggling around in his bassinet waiting for food, happy as can be. \n\nAny advice on this? Will he grow out of it eventually? I don’t pick him right up when it happens because I know he’s sleeping, but if I get to him in time I just rub his belly and let him know I’m there (his bassinet is at the foot of our bed instead of right next to us because it won’t fit next to our bed).",

I was just in your shoes last week: baby boy turned 4 months old, would wake up every 2-3 hours before the regression then woke up every 30mins-1hour during the regression, previous 2 hour day contact naps became 15 minute contact naps (he wouldn't stay asleep even when held), refused the bottle, distracted breastfeeding, rolling over while asleep then crying because he woke up, would not fall asleep even when fed.\n\nWe didn't do anything and just rode it out. It was especially difficult because I'm back to onsite work and my husband works 6pm-3am shifts plus commuting time; it was the first time I cried again since the newborn stages. Tried to sleep train but our baby hates the crib, hates the pacifier, and doesn't like white noise.\n\nThen suddenly there was a random night a night ago that he slept 8 hours straight. Since then he's been having 3-5 hour stretches at night, and would fall asleep again when fed. Naps are now longer (still all contact naps though, but we'll take it!).\n\nSo I can say it did get better for us! I don't think we did anything to affect the outcome, it was just our baby deciding to baby harder. Hope it gets better for you eventually as well.",

We’re just out of the regression which lasted 2-3 weeks and coincided with vaccines and a bad cold. There is a light at the end of the tunnel ❤️\n\nAt 4 months your baby does not need to nurse every hour, this is comfort nursing. And while that’s fine during the day, you do not have to feel bad about feeding only every 3hrs at night. I promise she won’t go hungry. You can follow 5-3-3 rule (first feed 5hrs after bedtime, then every 3hrs). This should give you at least a couple of hours of sleep in a row x3 times per night, even more if you go to bed at the same time as baby. I went from no sleep to 5-6hrs of sleep thanks to sleep training  and everybody is so much happier. My baby gives us the biggest smiles in the morning, even if there’s been some crying during the night. He’s in a much better mood during the day because his sleep is now restorative.\n\nI feel you about the contact naps, my baby is going on 5 months and we have just had a couple successes last weekend for the first nap of the day, and only 20min. Nap training doesn’t really work until 5-6 months anyway. Focus on the nights for now, and you’ll enjoy the cuddles again during the day.\n\nGood luck!!",

I stopped feeding bay every time she woke up (i knew she didn’t need to eat that often so I fed her 1/3 times or after a certain period of time had passed) unless I really couldn’t get her back down. I was way more aggressive with pumping and let others bottle feed her my breast milk. I let my husband sleep in another room so he was more helpful during the day, like doing pretty much all the cooking and cleaning. I baby wore when she contact napped so I knew I wouldnt drop her or squish her if I accidentally fell asleep while contact napping.

First wake up I go pretty much right away, second is 5 minute delay, third is 10 minute delay but never anything longer than 10 minutes. \n\nMy daughter had bad gas from overfeeding as I comfort nursed her a lot.

My daughter just went through literally the exact same thing and I was very worried about her. When my grandson was five months old, feeling ambivalent about sleep training but also feeling desperate, she implemented a program called Taking Cara Babies (imo, a gentler approach than Ferber) and it was life changing. Within a few nights he was sleeping through the night with only one middle of the night feeding. As an added benefit, he was less fussy during the day (I think because he had been almost as sleep deprived as my daughter.) Also, she was ebf but started supplementing with formula. We now think of it as the best of both worlds - baby gets all the antibodies and nutrition from her breast milk and also gets the added iron and vitamins from the formula. Plus, her husband can take some of the feeds so she can sleep. Please hang in there. Without a doubt it will get better.",

We are still cosleeping and breastfeeding now. I was super against cosleeping through all of pregnancy and for the first 4-5 months of my baby’s life. I got to the point of desperation and realized that us sleeping apart was really unnatural to me. Of course my breastfed baby wanted to be at the breast for comfort and security all night. I was very against sleep training too. Tried it several times and it just felt cruel.

My husband runs his own business remotely, so he's with LO during the day. \n\n5:00pm: Power nap for LO  \n5:30pm: I arrive home from work when LO wakes up from his power nap. I take over baby care so husband can wrap up his work for the day.   \n7:30pm: Final feeding and tubby time  \n8:30pm: Bedtime  \n8:30pm-10:30pm: Dinner and adult relaxation time\n\nLO wakes up around 7am, so I can usually do the morning feed and get him dressed for the day before I leave at 7:30am. It isn't perfect. I wish I could be home during the workweek more, but I get to see him for about four hours every workday. \n\nThis system is only possible because we \"set ourselves up for success\" on Sunday evenings. \n\n* We prep meals and ingredients as much as possible. Breakfast and lunch are always \"grab and go,\" while dinners are crockpot or cut and bagged for roasting. This allows us to enjoy a healthy, nutritious diet, cut costs on eating out, all with minimal effort.\n* We make sure laundry is put away and I lay out my outfits for the entire week. This includes 4 sets of workout gear, 1 \"comfy house\" outfit, and 5 business casual outfits. \n* I have a short list of household cleaning that must be completed each week weekend without exception. This includes the bathrooms, floors (vacuuming and quick Swiffer of heavy traffic hardwood floors), kitchen, dining room table (clear off clutter, sanitize), and a general tidy of the whole house. \n\nThis sounds like a lot, but if husband and I work together, it only takes a few hours after LO goes to bed. We find that it's worth the extra push - if the cleaning, meals, and laundry are out of the way before the weekend is over, our workweek is so much more enjoyable. All we have to do is toss dishes into the dishwasher at the end of the night and take the trash out midweek.",

As he has gotten older, I just keep him up longer. He’s 8 months and his last wake window is regularly 5-6 hours. I know that’s way too long according to the internet, but he does fine with it and it works well for our family. It allows him to eat dinner with us and have bath time and play with his sister too. He’s definitely pretty tired by bedtime, but he’s a kid who will zonk right out if he’s overtired instead of fighting sleep. I know not all kids are like that. \n\nI think sleep training culture has given us all the idea that babies need to be on a “perfect” schedule. This caused me a lot of stress with my first, but I threw everything out the window when my second came along and we’re all better for it.",

Say hello 5 mins, Nurse for 15-20 mins, eat solids in high chair for 20 mins (he is pretty tired at this point, but there isnt another option; daycare won't give any foods baby hasn't had at least once at home, so if we didn't do this baby would almost never have new foods or allergen introduction) , 15 mins for bath and teeth brushing, then pajamas and bed. No time for bedtime story plus he's usually screaming and crying during end of solids or bath or getting dressed, or during all of the above, because he is tired by that point anyway.\n\nBaby then sleeps until 6-6:15am, at which point we nurse and get already for the day so baby can be out the door to daycare with dad by 7am.",

As a new parent you are reading all those absurd horror stories of random antics babys develop while growing up. \"Surely mine won't do any of this shit.\", you are saying to yourself while a cheerful shiver crawls down your spine thinking of the unfortunate souls whose kids slowly drive them into madness.\n\nWell, what shall I say. Amongst many other things I wouldn't have believed if somebody would have told me some months ago my little one now started doing the dreaded \"death roll\" while trying to change his diapers. Preferably after doing number 2, consequently smearing shit everywhere.\n\nI often read when this happens you shall change the diaper when the kid is standing up. But how does this work? When trying to do this my little one is trying to walk away or throw himself to certain death off the table. Alternative he decides it is time to sit down, pressing his soiled ass on the wall, the table or preferably my arm. Quite often he also decides it's time for muscle training, resulting in rigid, tightly pressed together ass cheeks that are impossible to clean.\n\nSo please kindly answer me this question: What are your secrets getting changing a diaper while the baby stands up to work?",

Give them something irresistible to hold (a remote, a clean wipe packet, a toothbrush, anything novel) so they stay busy for the 20 seconds you need. Open the new diaper first, slide it between their legs from the front, secure one tab while they wiggle, then the other don’t aim for textbook-perfect symmetry. For poop, wipe as much as you can while they’re leaning over your arm or holding onto furniture; you’re not doing a spa treatment, just “good enough to close the diaper without disaster.” Many people do it on the floor instead of a table so there’s no falling hazard and they can’t run as easily.

At the time it felt fine, now it feels like I accidentally trapped myself.\n\nFast forward to now and she will not take a bottle at all. I’ve tried so many things:\n- Different bottles (at least 5)\n- Different teats and flow rates\n- Paced feeding, different positions, when she’s sleepy, when she’s calm\n\nEvery time it ends in crying. Sometimes she screams, sometimes I end up crying too. It’s awful.\n\nI’ve tried straw cups but she obviously doesn’t know how to suck from a straw yet. Open cups are a complete nightmare and honestly stressful for both of us. I know she actually likes the taste of the formula I’m using because she will take some from a bowl and spoon, but I can’t sit and spoon feed 6 oz every time she needs a feed. That’s just not practical and it makes me want to scream.\n\nI feel completely trapped by breastfeeding. I hate it right now. I’m touched out, my body doesn’t feel like mine, and I can’t ever fully relax because I’m always “on call” as the only way she eats. I thought by 6 months things would feel easier and instead I feel more stuck than ever.\n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. I’m at my wits’ end. I just want her to be able to take a bottle or something so I can start to wean and get a tiny bit of my life and my body back.\n\nIf anyone has been through this and actually got their baby to take a bottle or cup at this age, please tell me what worked. Routines, specific bottles, tricks, literally anything. I feel like I’m failing her and failing myself and I just need some hope that this can change. Please, please help me.",

I tend to quickly resort to feeding as I know it always chills him out instantly regardless of if he needs a change or burping. My baby eats alot which is evident from his gaining well over a kg in his first month of life and becoming a rather plump and gorgeous little munchkin*\n\nHe is always breastfeeding and for hours at a time. I'm worried this is over feeding him and teaching him that food is the only way to soothe ones self as has been indicated by a few people in my personal life who have had many children themselves.\n\nHe weighed 4.8kgs at his 5th week, starting off as a smaller than usual boy. \n\nHe never turns food away or shows he's had too much, he either simply falls asleep or stays on till he's over tired and fussy again. \n\nAll this to ask am I over feeding, if so what are your tips to help soothe your baby without feeding being the only option?\n\nUpdate from reading comments: \nThank you all, will definitely keep to checking first if he's hungry and letting him take his time to get all the feeding he wants.\nWill work towards not getting so hung up on the recommendations of those around me and just trust my gut feelings when it comes to my baby.",
